SO we are sticking with the now defamed  collective right theory  As of yet you have not explained:  How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments.  why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to  the people  in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd.  Ill keep it to 2 for now
