A long time ago, a simple experiment was proposed to supersport. This experiment could easily convince an observer of the validity of his viewpoint. All supersport has to do is tag some Biston betularia such that they can be identified individually, and move typica morphs to polluted areas and carbonaria to cleaner areas. If any individual changes form, supersport would be vindicated.  supersport has been ignoring this proposal since its introduction.
