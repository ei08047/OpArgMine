That right there is pretty much what some cops, mainly in the big cities like LA do. They make up stuff. They lie to make themselves look good and throw someone in jail. I'm not making this up. Then they go to the DA and bring up bogus charges on weapons that are 100% legal. Since the DA wants to look like he/she is doing something they don't pass it up. This is what guns laws do ladies and gentlemen. They victimize the innocent and let go of the bad ones.
