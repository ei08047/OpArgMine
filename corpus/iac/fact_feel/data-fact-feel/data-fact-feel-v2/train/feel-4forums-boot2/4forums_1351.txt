So you're saying that a person's right to defend themselves ends at the border of their state of residence?  How about a person's First Amendment rights? Should states be allowed to set limitations on free speech that're radically different from your own home state? Or how about driver's licenses? Should your license only be good in one state and one state only, and driving in a different state is a criminal offense?
