Eh. The funny thing is that the GOP is playing up fears to Seniors about government healthcare when Seniors have rated Medicare far more highly than private insurance. I always laugh when I see poor seniors holding up signs  No Government Healthcare.   Interestingly enough, for a party that accuses the Democrats of class warfare, they seem to have absolutely no problem doing it in the healthcare debate.
