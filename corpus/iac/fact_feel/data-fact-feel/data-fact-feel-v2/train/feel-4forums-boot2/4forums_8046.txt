I know that the soul exists, which is why I made my claim. Just as sin isn't a man made concept but a reality that is proven whenever you feel guilty for doing wrong. I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning, are you saying that you're a sociopath?  What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year?
