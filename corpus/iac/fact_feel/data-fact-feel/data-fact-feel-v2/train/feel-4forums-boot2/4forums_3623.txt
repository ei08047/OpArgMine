You are missing the point. Evolutionists say that certain animals in a population are GENETICALLY superior than others....and these genetic superiors are more successful breeders. Do you understand this concept? So when you say that more humans are born than reproduce, that's not particularly important because I submit those who go on to reproduce do so mostly because of choice or circumstance -- not because of their GENES. How can you possibly refute this?
