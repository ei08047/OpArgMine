This is true. Creationists, of course, are forced to make this bogus distinction, as the changes they call micro-evolution can hardly be denied, whilst what they call macro-evolution is the thing they are compelled to deny with every breath they take.  In the real world degrees of evolutionary change form a continuum, from point mutations conferring, say, antibiotic resistance on a bacterium, to full-scale genetic isolation and speciation. There is nowhere a sharp cut-off between qualitatively distinct levels of change. (In fact one of the major difficulties faced by creationists is explaining just what kind of mechanism would, in their view, enforce such a cut-off.)
