Really, I am not posting much information.  For example, recent events such as the resistence of Chile to Europeans of UNO, the division of the political party PRI in Mexico, due to abortion topic, etc., etc., have not been posted here.  I have posted mainly some information about women imprisoned recently for abortion.  It is important to spread that information because women impunity is a weak point of pro lifers.
