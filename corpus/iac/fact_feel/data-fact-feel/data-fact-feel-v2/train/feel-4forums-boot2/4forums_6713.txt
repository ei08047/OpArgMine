Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely, if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else. What interest would a state that doesn't recognize gay marriage in the first place have in allowing gay divorce?
