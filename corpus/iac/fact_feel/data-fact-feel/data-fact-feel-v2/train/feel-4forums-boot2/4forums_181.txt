Why not make your own communist faq then, one which is, though still completely wrong, in accordance with the principles of communism, and the writings of Marx? This FAQ is just trash.  It would appear the YCL have updated their faq then, and no longer deny Stalin's killings, or endorse North Korea.  In some sense it's understandable how poor quality it is, given that it is from a  youth  wing of the communist party, and as such targetted at propagandising towards illiterate teenagers - but why post such a thing here?
