In the word's of Marilyn   We, the people of the United States, in order that we shall have the right to preserve a State free for all races, shall achieve this end by the use of non-lethal weaponry only for our continued survival as human beings. This free State entails our personal self-defense as well as our right to our food consumption. In keeping with current government law, if we so choose to possess a non-lethal weapon (be it either upon our persons or within our private homes), we are obligated to store these aforementioned weapons plus any ammo relating to its use in a manner which will serve to protect the welfare of a minor child. To further secure our persons, we have the right to wear bullet-proof body armour, plus live in bullet-proof houses as well as drive bullet-proof vehicles.   Umm... Well. I think this is enough to make anyone laugh.  Wow, I love hippies!... *LOUD COUGH, LOUD COUGH*
