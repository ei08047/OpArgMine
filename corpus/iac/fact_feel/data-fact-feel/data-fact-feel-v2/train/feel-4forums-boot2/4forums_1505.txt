And??? What is the question? So none of the conditions that I mentioned and maybe some that I didn't even have the knowledge to consider don't exist in a zoo. And yet, I have some doubts about the survival of an animal in +100 degree temperatures when it is adapted to an environment where 50 degrees is hot, and -30 is common.
