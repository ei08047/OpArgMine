So let's see if we've got this right.  You're in favor of a procedure that's going to bog down the legal system even more, possibly bringing it to an outright and immovable standstill, by prosecuting people for having an unregistered firearm...while at the same time dropping felon in possession in charges against violent criminals that actually employ violence their victims to get what they want?  How do you intend to catch people to prosecute them?
