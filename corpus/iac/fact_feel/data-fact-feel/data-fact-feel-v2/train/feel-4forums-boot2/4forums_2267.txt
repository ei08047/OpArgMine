Carmen, it's senseless not to believe that Abortion is Planned Parenthood's #1 reccomendation. Does Planned Parenthood offer pregnancy support? No. Do they offer ultrasounds? No. Do they have maternity wards? No. What do they do? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions. That's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions. This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common! They get $40 million a year for abortions alone.
