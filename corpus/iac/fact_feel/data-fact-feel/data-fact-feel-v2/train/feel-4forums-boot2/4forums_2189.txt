What is the logic in saying that a mutation is random if the environment induces it? If someone smokes for 50 years and comes down with lung cancer, is it really random? If this is so random why don't 2-year old kids get lung cancer?  If everything was set by ID, then DNA would be unchangeable and therefore there would be no cancer  that's probably about the dumbest thing I've heard.....IDists have been promoting the concept of adaptive mutations for decades -- a concept darwinists detest. Contrary to your ignorant version, ID simply suggests that lifeforms don't change by way of happy accidents culled by selection -- as darwinists do.  Nobody care to answer me?: why would the cancer gene be selected?
