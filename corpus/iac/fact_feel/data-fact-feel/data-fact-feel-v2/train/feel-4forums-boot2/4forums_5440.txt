That their religious beliefs and freedom is more important then gay equality and civil rights.  2 Heteros that believe that gay people are sick, diseased, less then human, and that their family structure is the only one that should exist.  In both cases groups that have a sense that they are privleged and their privlege is more important then the rights and lives of gay people.
