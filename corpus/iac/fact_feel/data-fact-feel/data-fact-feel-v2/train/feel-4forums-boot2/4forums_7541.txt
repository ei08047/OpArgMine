Because, not once, did I have feel any sort of physical attraction to the same gender as myself. I have known other people who have. I don't 'CHOOSE' who I think is sexually attractive.  It might have been environmental, but it certainly wasn't a 'choice'  I have to assume that at least for some , if not most homosexuals, that pattern repeats itself.
