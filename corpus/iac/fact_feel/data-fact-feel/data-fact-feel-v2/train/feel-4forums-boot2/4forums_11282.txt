The idea of god having a plan for anyone is contradictive to the idea of free will. Either it is all in what he has planned or it is what he gave you the right to choose. And to go slightly off topic but not really, if gaof had a plan for everyone and only what is in the plan is what happens then it must be in his plan that I am gay.
