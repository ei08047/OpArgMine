What I'm saying is, if the police are going to abandon you, and the law prohibits you from protecting yourself with deadly force, what defense do you have should somebody decide that they're going to victimize you?  Exactly what kind of qualifications are you going by in declaring a nation  developed  if the government is unable to protect you, and they've actually made it a crime to try and protect yourself during your time of need?
