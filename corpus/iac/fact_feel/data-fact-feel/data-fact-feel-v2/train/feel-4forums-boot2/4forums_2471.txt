Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.
