BUT how is it not.....I have a committed realtionship, and after 4 years  ( longer than most heterosexual relationships) don't we deserve the same rights as you , even if.....you don't believe it is moral. We have given our lives to each other. How is that different from your relationship. Is yours better in some way?....NO it is not....
