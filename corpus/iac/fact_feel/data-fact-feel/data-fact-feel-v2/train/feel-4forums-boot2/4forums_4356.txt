I know what most pro-life people will say - they will make an exception in the case of rape. But what they don't consider is that in prohibiting all other abortions, they will make safe abortions less accessible to rape victims. So many abortion clinics would go out of business that even if rape victims are allowed to get an abortion, they won't be able to get an abortion. Not safely and easily, at least.
