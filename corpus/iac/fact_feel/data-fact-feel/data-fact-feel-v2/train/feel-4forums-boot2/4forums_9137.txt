200 years ago guns were necessary for hunting, defense against Indians etc. Guns were very useful then. Nowadays cars are very useful. We need them for transportation. We take cars for granted now. We're not afraid of the government taking them away. We don't think it's necessary to add an amendment which specifically protects the right to own and drive cars.
