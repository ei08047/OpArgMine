cmitch, you cite certain studies as the reasons for why laws have been passed forbidding underage drinking and gambling. Do you, by chance, know what those studies are?  Furthermore, why would your being legally unable to drink or gamble make you less of a human?  Does drinking and gambling make you more human?  I'm having difficulties in following your arguments.
