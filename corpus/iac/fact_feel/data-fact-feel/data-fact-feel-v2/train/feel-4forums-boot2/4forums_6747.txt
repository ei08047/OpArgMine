If they commit murder they have already done that to the victims, taken away their life and liberty.  Better to feel sorry for the victims family who are suffering their loss, had to identify their loved one and (in many cases) see the brutality that was inflicted on them. Feel sorry also for the victim who suffered such horror before their agony finally finished in death.
