But Peddlar's religion doesn't have reincarnation in this way so parasitised by wasps as a punishment isn't one of the options. Unless of course we are in Hell at the moment but just haven't realised it yet and avoided the worst stuff.  Still, I have a problem with punishing someone for something that they now have no idea about with something fairly horrific yet will forget soon as they die again, if they are even really aware of what is happening.
