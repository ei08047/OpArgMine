1. This was a statment based on british intelligence. Bush said  The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.  Now tell me how this is a lie. Did the British NOT say this?  2. Taliban is gone. Most of the top terrorists are caught. Osama is defanged and I beleve will be caught in the next few months.... How is this a lie?  3.  Uh I am an anti-american kool-aid drinker... Free thinking is what my government tells me to think.....
