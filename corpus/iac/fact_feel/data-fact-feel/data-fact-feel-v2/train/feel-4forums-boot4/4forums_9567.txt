No.  Do you think the government has the right to defend people from subjective harm?  Under that principle, I can write a book and someone can say,  This book makes me angry and hurts my feelings,  and the book would be banned. People will abuse the  subjective harm  principle to pass off all opinions they don't agree with as harmful.  So what if Terral03 speaks rudely? All it does is make him look bad. The honorable person reads his post and thinks  He's a pot-smoking idjot. Let him babble,  not  OMG that's so rude let's ban him!
