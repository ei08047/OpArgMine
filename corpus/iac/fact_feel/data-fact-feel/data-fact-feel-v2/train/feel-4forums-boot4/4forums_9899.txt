well, this thread has no place on this board BUT....  About the mistranslation of the word  virgin :  http://www.awitness.org/essays/twistis.html  http://www.awitness.org/essays/virginb.html  http://www.2think.org/hii/virgin.shtml  http://www.religioustolerance.org/virgin_b1.htm  About the mistranslation of  church :  http://www.bible-truth.org/Ekklesia.html  About the mistranslation of  fornicate :  http://www.geocities.com/davidjayjor...anslation.html  So, it seems that if we get one or two little words here the whole meaning is changed.  edit: misspelling
