Well, it is probably a different taste from what you are used to. I personally love Hershey's but that's probably because I grew up on it. European chocolate is supposed to be better but I don't have the taste buds for it...but I still like it. Plus Hershey Park was fun as a kid.  Now can we please stay on topic and talk about candy?
