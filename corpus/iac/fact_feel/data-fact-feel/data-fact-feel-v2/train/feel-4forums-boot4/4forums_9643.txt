He wasn't that special a case. Let's not forget about Giordano Bruno who was burned at the stake for refusing to recant his idea that that the stars in the sky were all suns with worlds and intellegent beings on them.  http://galileo.rice.edu/chr/bruno.html  but alas:  It is often maintained that Bruno was executed because of his Copernicanism and his belief in the infinity of inhabited worlds. In fact, we do not know the exact grounds on which he was declared a heretic because his file is missing from the records.  All the same, he was burned for being a heretic.
