'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful ? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth?  Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood?
