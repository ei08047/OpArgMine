Again, instead of dealing with the issues someone raises, you respond with wild, unsupported allegations and personal prejudices, not unbiased facts. How do you know there aren't MANY homosexuals without STD's or AIDS? I happend to be a 54 year old homosexual and have never had either. Neither has my partner. Neither of us are promiscious.You are just making inflamitory remarks.  Sodomy? Homosexuals hardly have a monopoly on any sex act, be it with a penis or a  foreign object ; be it anal or oral.  Again, you simply lack any credibility.
