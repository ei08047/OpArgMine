Because the rights to firearms are bestowed by God. Not by a king, not by a government, not by a judge, not by a group of men. The right to firearms are given to you in the same way as the right to reproduce, the right of freedom of thought, the right of speech, the right to vote.  The privildge to drive is given by the state.
