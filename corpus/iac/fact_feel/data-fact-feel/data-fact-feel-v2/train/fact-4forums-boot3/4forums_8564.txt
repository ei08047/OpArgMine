To Close_slave_can:  May be  overall  was the wrong word to use. By this, I mean, the whole naturalistic explaination about our origins. We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.  It is this that I am refering to. It is the interpretation about the origins of the evidence that all the debates in this forum are caused by. Sorry for any misunderstanding.
