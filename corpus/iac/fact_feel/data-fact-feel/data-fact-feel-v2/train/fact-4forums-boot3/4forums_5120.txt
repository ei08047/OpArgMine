If little Jimmy was dead, this analogy might have some merits. Otherwise, compassion for little Jimmy is naturally based on the agony he will feel when he wakes up... One could also feel compassion towards poor little Jimmys family and friends (in the case Jimmy is dead). Ecpessially if little Jimmys body has been mutilated by some weird ugly guy.
