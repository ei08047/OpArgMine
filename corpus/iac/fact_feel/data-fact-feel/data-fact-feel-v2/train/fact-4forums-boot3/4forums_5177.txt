Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated. If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.  Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea. Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?  What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
