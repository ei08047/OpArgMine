Can't agree about the current state of American education. Since most Nobel Laureates are in their 50's and 60's, these statistics indicate that as of about 35-40 years ago, the US education system was in good shape. We'll have to wait and see if the situation is the same in another 40 years to assess the current situation.  And of course the US will have more Nobel prizes; as one of the more populous developed countries there will naturally be a larger pool of humanity from which to pull.
