You seem to think that any time someone is killed, the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator  devalued human life . If that was the case, gun manufacturers, car manufacturers, breweries, and cigarette manufacturers would  devalue human life  simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse. And the government would  devalue human life  by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians. More often than not, the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or  militia , and the few that are killed by the US are accidents.
