The effects are not remotely similar.  Marijuana is not an effective pain reliever. It is commonly prescribed to treat nervous disorders and nausea.  They don't. The vast majority of users(not addicts) are functioning citizens. The fact that you don't know that proves the point.  This is old and tired. The only gateway is the dealer who is encouraged to carry multiple products. That and the fact that many young people figure that if they were lied to about the seriousness of dangers associated with marijuana, maybe those other drugs aren't as bad as they say either. Wonderful strategy on the part of the antis.  Except no one smokes 20-40 joints a day.
