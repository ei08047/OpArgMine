Or, spend three months pregnant and then get an abortion, then you lose only one  potential  human instead of four. (WHY MENSTRUAL CYCLES, GOD, WHY?!)  NOTE:  To clear up any misconception, I am not promoting, condoning, or admitting to the act of rape. This is simply parody of what happens when we use unrealistic standards. I'm sure that Joe doesn't promote the rape of women to prevent the passing of unfertilized ova, but I think that his lack of doing so is inconsistent with his position expounded upon above.
