I understand that the position is commonly called  Pro-life.  However, pro-life should not just concern abortion. Pro-life should be about safe sex, peace, stem cell research, exercise, healthy eating and pollution control. As of yet, I've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic. It truly is  Anti-Abortion  and some can argue that it is  Anti-Choice.  The reason it's not call anti-anything is because the prefix  anti  implies a negative, and all of our connotations make it a bad thing. No one wants to be anti-choice.  And seriously, other than people who directly profit from it, who is  pro-death?   As for the original post, it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies, or prevent them.
