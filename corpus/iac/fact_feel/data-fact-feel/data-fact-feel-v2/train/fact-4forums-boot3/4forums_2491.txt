Excellent post DamEtel, I'm continually impressed by your very knowledgeable and thorough contributions here.  The response you received was exactly what I was expecting.  When faced with evidence so powerful that a pseudoscience cannot even be developed to offer an alternate explanation (ID theory, flood geology, etc..), the reply is inevitably baseless if and buts, or the old standby -   The Lord works in mysterious ways.   To actually face the data head on would present a fundamental challenge to one's faith and religion, and that, as I'm sure you're aware, will be avoided at all cost.  Waxy
