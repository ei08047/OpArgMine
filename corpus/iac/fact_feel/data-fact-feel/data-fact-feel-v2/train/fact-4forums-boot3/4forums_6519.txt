**  Sheer nonsense. What couints is the functioning of the system as a whole. Reducing it to subsytems, and those subsystems to material and mechanical components, is a task subordinate to the principal, primary objective, i.e., an understanding of the whole, what is it that it is, why it does what it does, and how it does it. Only you anthropocentrically expand your psychological understanding of connotations of words pertaining to human social systems to all other systems, everywhere. But that is, of course, what you guys did when first you applied the term 'selection' to the behaviour of abstractions and other non-human entities, so no big surprise there, I guess.
