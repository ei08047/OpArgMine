 both sides of the debate ?  It would be a lot better if you could supply SUBSTANTIATED FACTS instead of wildly inaccurate claims.  Let's start simple.  The original article documents the CBO's observations on the Republican plan.  By 2019, CBO and JCT estimate, the number of nonelderly people without health insurance would be reduced by about 3 million relative to current law, leaving about 52 million nonelderly residents uninsured. The share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage in 2019 would be about 83 percent, roughly in line with the current share.How do you justify claims about  covering only a fraction more ?  Unless you're talking about  covering only a fraction more  THAN THE STATUS QUO, and significantly less than the Democrat plan...  THAT I agree with.
