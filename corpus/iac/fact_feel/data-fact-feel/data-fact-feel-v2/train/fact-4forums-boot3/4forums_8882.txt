I thought the critical factors were (are);  a: When does a child's life begin?  b: When does a new child's rights begin?  c: What are the possible justifications for denying the rights of the new child (if any)?  d: What (if any) should the punishment be for violating the child's rights by killing him or her unjustly?  Can we not (at least) agree on what the  critical factors  are?  If not, isn't all subsequent debate destined to be non-productive?
