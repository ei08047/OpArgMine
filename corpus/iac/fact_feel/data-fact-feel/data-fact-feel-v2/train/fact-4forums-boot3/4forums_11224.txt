Actually I believe life begins at conception, that that life matters and abortion ends that life.  I also believe mama comes first and until we can seriously address the issues faced by pregnant women rather than demonizing them that they will abort whether it's legal or not.  I also believe that there are times when abortion is appropriate and necessary.
