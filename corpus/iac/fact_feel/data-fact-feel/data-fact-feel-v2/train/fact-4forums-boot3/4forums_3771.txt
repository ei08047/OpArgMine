Well I'm pretty sure if it was cyber-enhancements then that dog never would have been born for you to see. It would be in a lab somewhere. You are right that it is possible that this is the case, but over time you would have found out about it assuming the dog was born for you to see indicating there is no cover-up or secret made of it and you would learn all about it in the future. A year goes by, scientists say it was genuine evolution. Would that be enough evidence?
