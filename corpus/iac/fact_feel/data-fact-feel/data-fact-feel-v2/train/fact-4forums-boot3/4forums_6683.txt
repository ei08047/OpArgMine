Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically, emotionally and economically.  Nobody has to be a parent. That is why there is adoption, safe-haven laws, the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes, an ever growing population of dead beat dads.  I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions. Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father.
