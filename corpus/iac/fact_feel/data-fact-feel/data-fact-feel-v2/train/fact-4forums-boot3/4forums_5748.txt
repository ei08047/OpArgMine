Yes, this is what I'm saying.  The  soul  and the  spirit  are the whole point of the bible's existence.  if it can't be plain about what they are and what to do with them,  then either god is a terrible author,  or (and this is the one you'll like) we are terrible readers.  Either way, god isn't making the instructions very clear.
