No, and no.  First, evolution provides the only scientific answers for how humans got here: we evolved from non-human ancestors. that record is written in both the genes and the fossils. Science might even be able eventually to tell you what the forces of selection were that propelled this evolution.  Second, Evolutionary theory is NOT a theory of the origins of life: it's a theory about the origins of species once life exists. There is a separate scientific discipline that deals with origins of life, called abiogenesis. And there are several lines of scientific evidence that suggest plausible ways of how that might have happened.  Why can't Creationists get these details right?
