I think that what you two are doing is simply trading evidences. Saying someone is 'wrong' and directing them to a atheist web-site is not proof. You should merely be saying, 'here is an alternative argument'  I say this because I can access a number of science posts that state the exact opposite of what you say, and show that they can find evidence for a flood.
