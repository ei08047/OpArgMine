Just as you constantly lie here to us on this board, now you are lying about your conduct on the road as a driver. I have had my license for a full 40 years now and have never had it revoked. Nor have I had an accident in over 25 years, but in those first 15 years I got 4 or 5 speeding tickets and all of them deserved. But none of them were for speeding in a school zone where children were present. And none of them were for public endangerment. I was famous for getting on the highway and cruising at 80 or 85 mph in a 65. By this woman doing 35 in a school zone, she was doing 15 mph over the legal limit where children are present; which of us do you think was more egregiously breaking the law?
