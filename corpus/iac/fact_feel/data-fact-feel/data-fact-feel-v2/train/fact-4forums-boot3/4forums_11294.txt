600? Oh really? Looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time. Making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic. The fact that there aren't specifics is a key failure in your argument. If the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate, terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere, yet they are not. You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is. Once again, anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition.
