No need to change the verbage:   ...individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments.   Like folks who migrated to northern latitudes and happened to have lighter skin(variation) were healthier and therefore produced more and healthier offspring. Over generations the lighter skinned came to dominate the group while becomming lighter still. Why is that so difficult? No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced. They just weren't as successful in the long run.
