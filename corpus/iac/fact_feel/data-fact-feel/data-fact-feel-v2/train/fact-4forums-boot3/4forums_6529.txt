No. I think that certian people are going to continue chiping away at the constution until things reach a critical mass, then there will be a violent correction. It is inevitable that a government whose growth is as radical as our governments will eventually collapse under it's own weight (see  Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire ).  The majority of Americans cannot describe america without including the words  freedom  and  rights . These are the supposed cornerstones of American society. When people see our constition, especially the bill of rights, chipped away at, I think it makes them uncomfortable, even if they do tolerate it.
