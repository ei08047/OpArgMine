Not sure who this was aimed at or even what it's based on, but like Duo Maxwell, I don't have a problem with those that are pro-environment, I consider myself pro-environment.  What I do have a problem with is misinformation and extremism. There's too much of both coming out of the  pro-environment  camp these days IMHO.  Waxy
