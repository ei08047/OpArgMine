In what universe is there a right to murder?  Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.  And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.  What certain activities are forbidden in public?  Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.  And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.
