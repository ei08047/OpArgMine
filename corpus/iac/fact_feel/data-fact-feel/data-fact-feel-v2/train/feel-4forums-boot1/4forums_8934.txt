No, nothing to do with it. Economics is not the product of morality...the most you can say is that one system of economics will be more flexible with different morality systems. It would be hard to argue that capitalism isn't the system to best handle different moralities.  And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality.
