Abortion is never justifiable homicide. It is never manslaughter. It is never an accidental killing. It is murder. It is the taking of a human life with malice and aforethought. If it goes un-punished in this life, rest assured that it will be judged by your creator in the next life. You liberal females who think that killing un-born children is a healthy activity are going to be in for a great surprise some day.  I have talked to many women who had abortions in their past; all of them were ashamed of what they did. For them, their guilt was almost too great to bear. So, I ask one more time; what person posting on this topic can say that they wish that their mothers had aborted them???
