You are quoting a biologist responding to a creationists' dishonest use of the word information, which he places in quote marks to illustrate the stupidity of using the word.  Then define information, your continued refusal to do so only highlights your intent to employ a shifting definition for the word. This is a standard creationist line of argument, have someone agree that something requires  information  in some general sense, and then redefine information as  something requiring a sender and receiver .
