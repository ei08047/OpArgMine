First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns!  However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following!  Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.
