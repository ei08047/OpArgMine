By that standard, Lurch, it could also be termed 'pro-choice/anti-choice'.  I am pro-choice. This is due to a mixture of believing that a woman should be better qualified than the government to chose what happens to her own body, that a foetus is not 'alive' until it can survive outside the womb and have a mental existence, and that in certain conditions (ie harmful to mother, terminally disabled foetus) denying someone the right to chose an abortion is nothing more than dodging responsibility.
