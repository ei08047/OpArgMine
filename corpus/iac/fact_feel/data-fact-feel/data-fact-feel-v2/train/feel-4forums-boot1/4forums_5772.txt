Sometimes having an abortion is the best option for them and their family. Financial commitments like a mortgage mean that many people need their full wage to get by, and if the mother had to go on maternity leave they would be seriously struggling and unable to feed their existing family. There are millions reasons for choosing to have an abortion and if a woman doesn't want to go through with a pregnancy, that is her decision as it's her body and her life that would be changing, and if she is unwilling to change her life she would hardly be an ideal person to become a fantastic mother.  I wouldn't ever say abortion is a good thing, and in an ideal world it wouldn't be necessary, but people make mistakes and birth control is not 100% effective so it's always going to be needed.
