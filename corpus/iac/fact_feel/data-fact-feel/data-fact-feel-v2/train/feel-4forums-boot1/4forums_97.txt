Not everything is simply black or white.  John 14:13-14,  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ask any think in my name, I will do it.   Does any one understand what  anything  means?[/quote]  If you want it to simply be black and white then I'll let you know that it is false.
