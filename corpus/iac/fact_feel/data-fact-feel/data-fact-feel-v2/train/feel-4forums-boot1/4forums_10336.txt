The concealed handgun liscense is irrevelant to the point that all states allow their residents to have guns in one way or another, but are the gun grabbers really dense enough to think that a maniac wont go on a killing spree unless he/she can get a concealed handgun licsense first? Does this maniac think to himself   I hope I can get that licsense so I can kill a bunch of people .
