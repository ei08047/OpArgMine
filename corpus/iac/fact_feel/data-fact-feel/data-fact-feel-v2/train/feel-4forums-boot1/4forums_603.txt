Fear created by buglers made the home owner do what he did! You have a problem because he shot them on their way out. I guess you have some way of knowing that these criminals would never return to once again create fear in the home owner. Making unarmed people live in fear is about all you demand of the law-abiding citizens. To bad you do not turn your attention to the criminals and leave the law-abiding citizens alone!
