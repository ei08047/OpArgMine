Well that was a good start. Are you planning on insulting everyone who replies to your post?  Of course it would be more difficult for criminals to get hold of guns if there were fewer of them around. It would also make it more difficult for children to get hold of them, or feuding neighbours who, on the spur of the moment, think that waving a gun around might bring about a solution to their problems.  If you don't think you're going to like the answers to your question, then don't ask the question.  Smiley
