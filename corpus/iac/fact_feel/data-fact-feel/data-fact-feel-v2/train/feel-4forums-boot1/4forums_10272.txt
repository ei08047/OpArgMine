Yes, and blacks weren't being prohibited from being married because of their skin color. A Black man could marry any black woman (and white and white) that would have him, and a black woman cold marry and black man that would have her. A blackwoman could marry any black man that would have her. They were not denied the right to marry, so long as they complied with the rules of marriage - including the one about one black to one black and one white to one white.  I'm quite sure you'd be just fine to hop back to that................
