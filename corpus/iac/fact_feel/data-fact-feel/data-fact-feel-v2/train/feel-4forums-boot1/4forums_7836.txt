Actually its not sickening in any way. These kids are at risk and need to know the resources available to them to avoid realizing those risks. Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future. Knowledge can keep them out of deep trouble. Ignorance will not do so.
