That question is ignorant. Why would any evolutionary biologist make such a stupid claim? Do you actually think that by implying that such stupidity is a claim of evolutionary biology you are somehow showing that it is wrong? You don't seem to be able to actually offer any facts that refute evolutionary theory so I guess it is necessary to resort to nonsense in hopes that the stupid will believe you.
