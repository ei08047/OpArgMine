As to the decline of moral fortitude in this country... these radical voices will do much harm to their standing socially. They are lashing out in angst at the root of their behavioral conviction not at all giving heed to the millions of voters who are not particularly religious, or gay [yes - gay voters voted for it as well] who understand the over arching significance of having a lifestyle ordinance enforced by the state, its just wrong and will do significant harm to the country if not put down. It is flatly flys in the face of what defines morally clear legislation and reveals nothing more than a social agenda wanting to force its lawlessness on the public in general. They were reminded that they are survived by the grace of these who live and let live, and may find themselves on even a shorter social rope if they don't ease up on their madness being projected at people who have done nothing to them... ever.  It will ultimately backfire on them... best be assured of that.
