So police who are not military and are civilians, unless you are paid by the DOD and come under the geneva Convention you are a civilian period.  If you had of paid attention, you should know that it is not the  standing army  that is fighting the current wars, it is oath taking militia/civilians from the State National Guards and reserve forces who have taken the same oath many of us have, to protect the Constitution from all enemies both domestic and foreign. That is not to say that only those people are the militia either!  Can you name one successful government that has ever won a guerrilla war? Russia fought in Afghanistan for how long before it limped back home?
