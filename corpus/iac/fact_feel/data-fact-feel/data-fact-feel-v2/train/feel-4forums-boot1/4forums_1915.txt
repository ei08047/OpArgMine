I think it could impact the health of the man. Seems you are downplaying the role of a man in a childs life. For shame!  I don't know how you could say the two aren't comparable. You argument is that the mother shouldn't have to support someone that she doesn't wish to support. You are now trying to qualify it by saying a mothers health is the main concern because health is more important than money. So your standard seems to be  If the human is being supported by another and may adversly hurt someones health than there should be a choice. Otherwise we can restrict choice.  Ok, what if child support will cause the man to have to eat worse or work more and thus hurting his health? Does this not qualify now? The man 1) didn't have a choice and 2) has his health adversly affected.  Looks to me like you just have a double standard.
