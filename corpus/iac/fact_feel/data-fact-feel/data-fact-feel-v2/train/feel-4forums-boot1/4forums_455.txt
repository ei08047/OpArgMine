That is irrelevent. One of the things that should always be hammered home to students in any science class is to never blindly accept what you are taught as fact, but to question and challenge it.  Of course religion is taught the same, no? You have been encouraged to question every verse in the Bible, to compare it to other religions, to question the evidence and the teacher at every stage, have you not? Of course not. You have been told to believe the Bible and to not question it, for it is  the word of God . I think that is the root cause of your problem. We aren't demanding that you accept evolution, geology, cosmology etc without question. Instead we are encouraging you to question, to doubt and to think for yourself. You can't deal with the lack of security that this approach offers.
