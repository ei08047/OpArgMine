You're right, as well as having the institution of marriage on the line. But you are the one who seems to think this is a game, based on your posts. (with your comments like  you've won ;  he's lost , and other silly things, as if this is a basketball game or something.) It seems you'd do well to take your own advice.  If you want people to constantly have to  justify  something to you, then you should make your own compelling arguments first; throw something out there yourself rather than expect everyone else to do it for you. No one owes you anything here. As for me, I'm not interested in your little games.
