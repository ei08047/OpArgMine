And rightfully so. I'll prove it with the exact legislation.  That group is owned by Bloomberg's mob squad. You remember Bloomberg, right? The mayor that got in hot water with the ATF and told that his actions amounted to criminal actions?  I've noticed a pattern too. You come on about once a month, spread a bunch of bull, and then run like to hide where it's safe and contradicting opinions can't reach you.  It'll force them to focus more on actual crimes rather than harassment tactics.
