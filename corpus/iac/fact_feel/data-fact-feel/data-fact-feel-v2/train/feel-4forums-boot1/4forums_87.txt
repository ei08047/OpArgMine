I think the gun lobby contributes to the problem- rather than encouraging gun owners to be responsible and to store their firearms safely they inflate people's fears about criminals. As a result, some gun owners feel they always need to have a loaded gun around even if it's endangering their children.  Merely hiding your guns is not enough. Children can find guns that are hidden. I remember staying at my grandfather's house during the summers as a child. After a little exploration, I found the rifle he kept down in the basement and the rifle and ammunition that was in one of the bedrooms on the ground floor. Guns need to be stored under lock and key to prevent children from accessing them. Trigger locks could help too.
