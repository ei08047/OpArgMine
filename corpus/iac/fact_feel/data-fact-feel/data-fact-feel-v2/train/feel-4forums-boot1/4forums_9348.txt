I think you mean things like the tax structure for filing as a married couple or maybe the social security benefits? I think that when these systems were being set up, there was(is) the mentality that a married couple is a family and that the  rights  of a married couple are the same rights as that of blood relations.  What's going on now with the gay marriage stuff is simply to get their marriage to be legally recognized so that they can have certian  rights  when it comes to things like social security and inheritance, etc.
