Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes.  However Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell.
