Actually looking back I wish I hadn't posted a lot of what is on those websites. It is a lot of poor arguments and I'm glad I was able to realize that over the last 3 months.  Had I already decided to believe that all of it was true I wouldn't be here debating you now.  You say I don't want to know. I wonder if you would want to know if God didn't exist. Is that why at the end of your post you seem so unhappy to debate this further?
