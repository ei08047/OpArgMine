.  This is the most obscene,disgusting and down right vilest thing i have ever had the misfortune to come across.Do you watch the news or read the papers,because it was all over the national news and the papers so much in fact that the goverment set up an inquiry,and a commitee to deal with it.  To say my sons body was salvage is bang out of order and i would thank you to think about the effect that your uncaring words have on people.  How long have been on this board,because it is all over the place that fishx{my wife} is staunchly pro life and it would of been more helpful for your case than asking such a stupid question as to ask if she had had an abortion.  You live in good old blighty and yet claim no knowledge of what was going on do you not remember alder hey childrens hospital.The system you are discussing is the same system that you live under,it was hope hospital in salford that took my babys body and never returned it.
