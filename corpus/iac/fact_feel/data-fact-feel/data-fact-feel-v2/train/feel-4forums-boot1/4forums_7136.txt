The problem with your statement is that freedom of religion is specificly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Government recognition of marriage is not.  As I have told Mathew S on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages. You are also free to vote your opinion on such initatives, but so is everyone else.
