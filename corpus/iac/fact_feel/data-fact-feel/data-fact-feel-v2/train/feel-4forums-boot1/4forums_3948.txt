Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages). I plan on buying from them when they get it back, and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it. Partly because I think it is very telling, partly because I remember what it was like to be in college and get a little recognition for your work.
