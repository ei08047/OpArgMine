Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences.  I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live. Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more, but all people don't.
