Sorry you feel like that. But in a fight to the death there are no rules of decent society. I will cheat and use every advantage I can get to stop a felon trying to take my life.  When the police use a stun gun, his partner is standing right next to him as a backup with a 12-guage shotgun. When you sign up for that stun gun, buy then extra optional accessory of a partner with a 12-guage shotgun.
