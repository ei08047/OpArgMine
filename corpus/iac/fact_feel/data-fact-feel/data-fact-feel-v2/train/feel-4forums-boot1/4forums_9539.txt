No, it's ALL of Canada which has legal marriage for same-sex couples! This is great news about California! But I had to correct that point, being Canadian. I do remember how I felt the day our most populous province, where I live, Ontario, made me an equal citizen. Soon the rest of Canada, followed. I wish the same for Californians and Americans. It's a wonderful feeling, hard to describe!
