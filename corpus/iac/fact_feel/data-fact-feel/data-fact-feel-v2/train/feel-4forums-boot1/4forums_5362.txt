Yes - drug use is another arena where you, the morality police and big brother can also bugger off.  And just like people smoke doobies despite their being illegal - you can bet your XXX I will have an abortion if I (me, myself, I - not you, Bush the horse or da Pope) determine it is detrimental to myself and whatever laws you have passed to increase your comfort level and the illusion that you have actually doen anything to help (a sad misconception) be damned.  You are missing the point of my using the quote. It is not an excuse for any kind of behavior. It is me, telling you, and anyone else who cares to meddle in my private affairs that they are not welcome there and I will not be taking into consideration for one second what any of you think.
