NO NO NO gays should not be able to marry! I can not believe in how secular this country is becoming if we let gays marry it will ruin are tradition in this country because if we let this happen we will have let men to marry as many women as they want same goes for women do to the equal protection act. MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN 1 MAN AND 1 WOMEN PERIOD.  ps sorry for the caps
