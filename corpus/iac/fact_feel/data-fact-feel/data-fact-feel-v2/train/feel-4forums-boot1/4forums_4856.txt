I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be  leaving  at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.  Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge.  Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.  --Chuz
