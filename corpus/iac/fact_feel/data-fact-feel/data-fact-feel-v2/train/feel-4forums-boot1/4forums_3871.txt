My claim is that an aggressive move towards a police officer will get you an aggressive response. Should the officer have released the man, still armed, in order to let him get out his permit? The man was not arrested for having the gun, was he?  If I were a police officer, I'd prefer to explain to my supervisor why I may have overreacted, than to have my wife explain to the kids why daddy won't ever be coming home again.  Which details have I manufactured? I watched the clip. That is all.
