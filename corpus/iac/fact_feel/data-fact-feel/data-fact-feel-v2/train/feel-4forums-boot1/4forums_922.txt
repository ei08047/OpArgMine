I think if you man guns criminals will just keep using guns. Production of illegal firearms in Britain is apparently through the roof. They are converting starting pistols and  non firing  replicas into regular weapons.  Trying to prevent criminal use of firearms by making firearms illegal is stupid. Idiotic. I cannot even think of astrong enough word to describe the stupidity of that moronic mindset.
