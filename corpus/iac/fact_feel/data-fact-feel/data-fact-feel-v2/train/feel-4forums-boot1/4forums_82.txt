the question doesnt mean to ask what part of the universe or what direction/location is God. it means how did the concept of God get itself to mankind. think about it. we live in a time influenced strongly by information and technology. in the earlier ages, myths and mysteries dominated cultures and society. suppose mankind started off in the state of physical understanding that we are in today, meaning, suppose we always understood the body, the earth, the cosmos, etc, in the way we understand them today. do you think that people would still come to the conclusion that God exists?
