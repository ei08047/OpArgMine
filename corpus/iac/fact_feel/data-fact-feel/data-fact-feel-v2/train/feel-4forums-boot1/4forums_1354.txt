But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?  Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with  philosophical pronouncements  that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond  atheistic philosophical pronouncements.
