IMO, that's beside the point. The problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people. Sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. So I think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. Of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat.
