I'm not sure it would even come up. The requirements to get a license in Mass are rigorous enough that no one would go to Mass just to fascilitate getting married. There's a waiting period, and you need a blood test, among other things. If you're straight and need to go to another state because your state won't marry you, Mass probably wouldn't be the state you'ld go to.  Sorry, couldn't follow that. Straight or gay couples? Which state is recognizing? And what's an LCR?
