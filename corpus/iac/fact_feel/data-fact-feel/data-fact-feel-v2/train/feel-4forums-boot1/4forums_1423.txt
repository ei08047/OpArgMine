Thinking, logical people do not automatically accept that government entities are qualified to make logical, well thought out rulings on things that truly matter. Who would ever have dreamed that officials could or ever would decide that destroying a life which exist, though it is incapable of expressing it's will to survive, as is natural for any living being, should be snuffed out at the whim of someone who indulged in the activity which produces life when they were not ready to deal with that life? Thus they give little thought to what those who spin un-thought out ideas as evidence.
