Rationalizing again It is  It's truly less harmful than alcohol.[/quote] Rationalizing again It is still worse then alcohol with one beer or even 2 beers a day (which is pretty much average for a person of non-college age). You have a guy drink a beer a day and a guy smoke up a day and see the difference in 50yrs...you will know which one is the weed addict.  I've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably won't convince me it is a good drug....however, like alcohol, it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them.
