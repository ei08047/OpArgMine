No problem. I personally believe killing innocent children is wrong. Yet, I also believe that a woman's decision to murder her child is between her and her god. I wouldn't remove individual choice. It's not mine to make.  But this isn't the right forum for that.  Back to the OP: False dichotomy, or obfuscation and refusal to answer the stated question?
