You live in a shed in the middle of the woods dont you? Possibly having scripture verses painted on your walls instead of wallpaper. I bet you know stats of all kinds..like how many people died from smoking last year, or in car crashes. Perhaps your knowledge of these  power Facts  makes up for power that you lack in most other areas of life. You have misunderstood me from the beginning. Your thoughts are the only thing in this conversation that are out of  conÂ·text .  You cannot go wrong quoting scripture..I agree with it. But you dont sound like you want somebody to agree with you...in fact you attack a fellow believer when they ask a question, or paraphrase a scripture to ask a question that may pose a counter point to what you are saying... and on top of that you interpret that as propaganda... nowhere in your definition did I see propaganda as a question. One thing I am glad about, if past experiance or knowledge does not hold water... then you are no expert here either. Funny how that works.. isnt it?  Like apples?
