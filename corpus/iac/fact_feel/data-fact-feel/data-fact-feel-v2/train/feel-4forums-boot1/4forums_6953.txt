Certainly and I'm all about personal responsibility as well. That's why I have no problem with time limits and other limitations being placed on abortion... What's important though, is that the paramount concern should be that a woman must retain the right to control her own body all semantics of when life begins aside. For there to be true equality between the sexes (which I feel is one of the most important conditions to having a truly free, just, and legitimate society) woman must be able to stand on equal footing and they can't do that if they don't have some means of control over their reproductive systems.
