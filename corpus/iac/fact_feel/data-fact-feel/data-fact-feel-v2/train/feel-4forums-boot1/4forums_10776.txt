Second period, here's fourth period's response.  Maybe we should look in our own backyards before we criticize . . . if one picks a fights, and fights the fight, then don't offer advice on harrassment.  Brandon thinks the school's administrators should come down hard on groups of harrassers. Just get rid of them.  Megan believes in grass roots approaches. Students can influence other students. If you see someone harrassing some else, suck it up, go over and tell them to knock it off. Be a leader!  Carolyn . . . people with personal power, (that's right, you popular folks) should stand up and do the right thing. Use your personal power to make school a better place for everyone . . . popular or unpopular. Don't let the bullies win!
