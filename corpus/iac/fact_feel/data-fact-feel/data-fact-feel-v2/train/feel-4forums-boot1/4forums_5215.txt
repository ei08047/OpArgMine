My grandma, at the age of 93, didn't recognize his son, nephew...  She thought her husband was still alive.  And she  lived  like this three years.  I don't want to make it compulsory but, in my case, the age of 85 would be a fair target.  I don't want to live longer than 85, progressively turning into a  speaking vegetable .
