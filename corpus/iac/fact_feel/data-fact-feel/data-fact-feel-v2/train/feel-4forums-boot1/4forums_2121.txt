how is that fair? basically your reasoning is  lets just give the christians the whole marriage thing, and let the gays get married at city hall by a 67 year old judge who probably doesnt agree with them anyways.   i mean, what happened to the separtion of church and state? did we, somewhere along the line forget, that little document we call the constitution. it dosnt simply say  see bible   everybody should have equal rights. no matter your race, creed, or religion. if joe and bob want to get married, how the heck is it our place to stop them? and im sorry if it makes you uncomfortable to think of that, but unless joe comes to your house to shoot your dog, its not really your concern.  and come on, im tired of all these ppl using the bible to cover up simple ignorance and prejudice.  so why dont we all take a hop-skip-and- jump into 2007, re evaluate our morals, and get a clue.
