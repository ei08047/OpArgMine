I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.  As Another_opinion hinted, another factor is the fact that until around the end of the second trimester, I do not believe that a foetus is a person - something that made the choice to abort much easier for me than it is for some women whose religions have brainwashed them to worship the holy fertilized egg.
