So it is a bad thing that children read about people and families that exisist and that they are likely to come across? What about King and King? That is a story of a prince falling in love with another prince. If King and king has an agenda then so does snow white, cinderella, Repunzel, and sleeping beauty. Ever read the real stories for yourself, not the cleaned up Disney versions, they are gruesome little tales that would give any child nightmares and make King and King look tame.
