If the 2nd is out of date, then lets do away with free speech, fair trials, and rights against cruel and unusual punishment. After all, these are all out of date after over 230 years. Or are you saying  I only want to ban the amendments that I don't like ? Your argument lacks some logic.  I wouln't call it  self defence  so much as I would call it  hiding and letting crooks trample all over you.   What kind of  gun crime  are you refering to?  Correction: they need not fear a citizens militia as long as they don't pass unjust laws.  Better safe than sorry.
