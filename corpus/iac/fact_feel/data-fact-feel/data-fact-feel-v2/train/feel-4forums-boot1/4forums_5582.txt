I've asked this question and many others you may see me post, in a number of other forums. I've recieved similar arguments, about a country not deciding to invade us. No Particular country was ever mentioned, However, if possible, I would like to belatedly clarify that I am asking this question in the context of the time we are now living in, as opposed to any other time. (I'm not sure if I made that at all clear in the post that started the thread.)  (I take it that this question has been asked before in this forum, rather recently, I assume??? If not in an initial thread post, then perhaps within another thread.)
