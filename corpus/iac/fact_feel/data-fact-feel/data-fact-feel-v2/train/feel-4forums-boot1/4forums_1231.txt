I post here to better understand the reasons behind the pro-life position and to present my own conditional pro-choice arguements both in the hope of convincing others and to let my views stand up to scrutiny (so that I could adapt them if I heard a reasonable opposing arguement).  By the way, based on the  A Pole  thread, those who were ambivalent and had their views changed by this forum all changed to pro-choice, not to pro-life. This means that those of you who are pro-life need to do a better job in your posts if you wish to convince people.
