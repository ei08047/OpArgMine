So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.  A woman who has an abortion out of convenience or as just a form of after-the-act birth control is hardly exercising determination of what constitutes a person, at all. She just wants out with no regard for the baby. People like myself don't so much have a problem with choice if your movement will at least acknowledge and show the value of the life growing inside that will be a child, adolescent, and adult rather than ONLY focusing on the mother as if the fetus has no relevance or value whatsoever. We just want to save lives of those needlessly killed.
