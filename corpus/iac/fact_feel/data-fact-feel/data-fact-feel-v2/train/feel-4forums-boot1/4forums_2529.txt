So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?Nope he does not believe in natural selection either. He believes that genes (and epigenetics) are the product of direct intelligent modification by the species which is evolving. He believes in what one has to call intelligent vitalism. Basiclly Lamarckism with some bells and whistles.  In fact he is simply an anti-evolutionist and probably a creationist at heart. Do not expect cogent scientific argument from his direction.
