Your little rant is irrelevant. The simple fact remains that Chicago's laws aren't respected or shared by the rest of Illinois. Therefore once you leave Chicago city limits, the gun ban dissolves and you can buy anything the state sells. And once that's done there's nothing but the honor system to prevent somebody from bringing something back into Chicago.  Face facts, their ban is useless, unenforceable, unconstitutional, and unjustifiable.
