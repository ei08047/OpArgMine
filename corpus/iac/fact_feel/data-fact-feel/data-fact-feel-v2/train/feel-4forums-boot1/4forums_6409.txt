I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.
