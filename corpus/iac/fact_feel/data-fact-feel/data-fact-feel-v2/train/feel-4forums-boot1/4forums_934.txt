In a subway station, 1 day after 4 more botched bombings, which followed 4 deadly bombings? Absolutely. Kill him...twice. I also kinda got the impression that when he was tackled to the ground that he tucked his arms under his body, and it could be thought that maybe he was attempting to get at a detonator, or actuate a detonator. Great job in my opinion.  I was also thinking, that perhaps a terrorist could gain great benefit from what happened in this case by learning the programmed response and tactics of the police. It almost seems like the media has been holding school on how and how not to be a terrorist bomber lately.
