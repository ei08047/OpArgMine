I find it difficult to believe that one would be banned from this site simply for not learning about evolution. There must be something else involved here.  Either someone is joking with you about having you banned or you're not telling us the whole story.  Now if there's a move to ban you for incessant challenges of things that have been clearly explained over and over and over, there may be grounds for extraction.  I'd like to read the whole story.  Will the real moderator please stand up?
