Yes, we should address social ills but until a society is achieved that is free of social ills then we'll still need gun-control. If gun-control preserves lives then it's increasing the freedom of good citizens.  Life is a very important right and freedom. Would you discourage people from having burglar alarms or from locking their doors? Burglar alarms and locks don't address the root causes of crime, but I'm still going to lock my door until a society that is free of social ills is achieved.
