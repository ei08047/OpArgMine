You quoted the article, which said what the OPPONENTS of gay marriage were saying.  Why should the AG waste time creating ballot titles for initiatives that may never get enough signatures to even get on the ballot?  You GET the signatures so that you can get ON the ballot in the first place.  Do YOU think that?  Did they make ANY explicit condemnation of the AG for failing to give something? No.  Did they seek any lawsuits to make the AG give them something he was required to? No.  It makes no sense for the AG to waste his time running around naming ballot initiatives that DO NOT HAVE THE SIGNATURES to even be put on the ballot.  The logical sequence is that the initiative proponents present the necessary signatures to get on the ballot.  THEN he gives it a ballot title.  Why give a  ballot title  to something that doesn't have enough signatures to be put on the ballot?  Opponents say they are dropping their efforts to qualify the repeal initiatives for this fall's ballot because neither has received a state-approved ballot title and the deadline for turning in signatures is only a few weeks away -- July 3rd.[/quote]  Archie, the other thing about this is WHY would you stop your signature drive just because you don't have a title?  They could continue to get signatures while they pressure the AG for a ballot name, if that were a legitimate avenue.  The fact that they have dropped out SO PREMATURELY should tell you something, if you bothered to try to think about it.
