A consequence of the pro-choice position would mean the man doesn't pay child support unless he wants to. It is irrelevant who carries the child. Maybe he is not ready for a child...this is the same excuse allowable for women under the pro-choice argument. So he shouldn't have to pay it if he doesn't want to. In fact, alimony she go the same way under the pro-choice thinking. If not then you just look like a hypocrite.
