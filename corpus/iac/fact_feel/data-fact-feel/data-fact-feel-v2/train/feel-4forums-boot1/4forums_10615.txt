That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.
