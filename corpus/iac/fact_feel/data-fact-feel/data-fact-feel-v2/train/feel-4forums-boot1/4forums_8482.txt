No, but I agree with him that we should all be able to find our own spirituality without the religious hound dogs tracking us down.  I don't think he would agree with how you and others approach the religious posts in this forum either.  Even though I don't agree with everything I read of him, which is not much, I do think he's on the right track. I hope he can find the answers he's looking for. Who knows, he may even be able to find a cure for stupid.
