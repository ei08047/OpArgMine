First off, God is asinine enough to kill what your ilk calls  innocent foetuses , etc., so I wouldn't put anything past him.  Secondly, I see you are falling into the usual O.P. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard  n  is right next to  b  last time I checked). Really Phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors.
