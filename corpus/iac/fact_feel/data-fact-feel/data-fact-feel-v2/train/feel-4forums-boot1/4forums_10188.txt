Since when does the word  access  get translated into  must perform ?  Women should have access to all medical diagnostic tests that can help them throughout their pregnancy. They should have access to sonagrams, CAT Scans, EKGs, EEGs, MRIs, blood tests, X-rays, etc., None of these are forced procedures or tests now. While I haven't read the actual text of the legislation, I would find it unfathomable that any legislator would force a woman into a medical procedure.
