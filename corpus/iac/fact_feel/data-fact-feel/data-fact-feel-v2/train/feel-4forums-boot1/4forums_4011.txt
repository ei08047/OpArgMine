I think this is where the pro-life and pro-choice people really get things messed up...Pro-choices views it as you do Jitobear...whether a mothers rights supercedes the childs rights as opposed to a pro-lifer who believes that everyone has the same rights and the question becomes what rights are  on the top  so to speak. In more detail I guess you could say  is it a right or a want and what would be a right and do we have finite rights . Pesonally, the right to life is kind of the start of every other  right  or  want  or anything for that matter...so above all you got that one. I never see it as choosing women over child or whatever because I don't see a difference in the two (as people).
