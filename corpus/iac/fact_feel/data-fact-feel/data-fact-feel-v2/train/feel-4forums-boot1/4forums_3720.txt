I would favor capital punishment IF our system was always fair and equal, it is not ..... would O.J. have walked if he had been a poor man? I would support capital punishment if we only convicted guilty men ... that is not the case. The list of men on death row who were found to be innocent and released is long and growing, and we can only guess how many innocents have been put to death. To me the harshest punishment would be to wake up knowing that this day would be like yesterday and tomorrow will be like today - for the rest of my life. Anyone who has had surgery can tell you that being put to sleep with chemicals is absolutely painless. Deterrent? Do states with the death penalty have a lower murder per capita than those that do? From a fiscal standpoint, it is cheaper to keep the convicted in prison for life than it is to execute them, and a whole lot easier to correct an error. Will we continue to have state sanctioned revenge? Probably.  Dono
