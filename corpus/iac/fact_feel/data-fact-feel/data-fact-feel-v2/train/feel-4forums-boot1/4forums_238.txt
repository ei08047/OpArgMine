Correction: If one isn't a fundementalist, literal christian, jew or muslim, then marc considers them a atheist.  He's never going to deal with the fact that he's quite wrong on that subject. It's obvious to everyone that he's constantly avoiding it even when asked point blank several times. A sign of argumental failure is constant avoidance of a simple question.
