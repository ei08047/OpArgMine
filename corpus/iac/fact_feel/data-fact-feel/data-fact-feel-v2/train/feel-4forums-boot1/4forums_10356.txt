This isn't interesting at all. What did these magical  light-sensitive cells  evolve from? What were they before and what event or process caused them to evolve into light sensing cells? Why do bats continue to rely on sonar to  see?  Why haven't they evolved eyes over time? In my opinion, this guy is basically saying that if you had a bunch of bricks and mortar, a building could be built. He just leaves out how you get the bricks and mortar, which is the whole problem.
