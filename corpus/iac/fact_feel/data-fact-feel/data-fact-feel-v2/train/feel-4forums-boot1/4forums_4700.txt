Upon the case, and how far in she is. I will never believe in it, however my views upon what would happen AFTER she gave birth to the baby.  If she was too deep, then I think that her baby should be taken away from her. However, if she could be saved, I think that she should go into therapy, and then only when she is defined to be past postpartum depression, may she be allowed the privilege of handling human life. Anything else would be too dangerous to her and the baby.
