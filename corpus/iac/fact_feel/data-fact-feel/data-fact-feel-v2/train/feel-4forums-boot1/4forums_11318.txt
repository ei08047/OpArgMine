Like campaigning for better information on and access to b/c you mean? That's what pro-choice groups do. Like seeking to improve benefits and general support for single parents? yup, they do that too.  As an individual, i give up time and resources to help the local family planning clinic. I ran sexual health campaigns at college. I recently did a drive to get goods to sell at a jumble sale, the profits of which go to a local single parent (note - not just single mother) group - and that's just for starters. What do you do to help lower the abortion rate?
