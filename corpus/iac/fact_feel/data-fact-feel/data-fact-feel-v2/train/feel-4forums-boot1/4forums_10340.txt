So if we were to actually do a true compromise, and not a Constitutional Compromise with the 2nd Amendment haters, most of all of this above would have to go!  However, that is NOT at all what THEY mean! What they mean give me half of the Constitutionally Recognized as protected Inalienable Rights they have not taken from you yet! Then after you have done the reasonable thing,(In their reckless unconstitutional minds) then they will ask you to compromise yet again, and again, and again, and again, and again and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.  Well, you get the picture!
