And so on. Yes. a lie generated by creationist liars is what you use as source for what scientists are claimed to adhere to? Your dishonesty is actually rather startling. This is the worst attempt at dishonesty I have seen from lying creationists yet, and your gleeful introduction of that lie shows how truly and completely dishonest you are. Would you stop your lies. You are pathetic.
