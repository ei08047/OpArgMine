You are repeating some more sensational hogwash and creating a false delimma yourself. You still haven't learned this is a REPUBLIC and not a democratic society? You ignore the Rule of Law. Just as King George ignored the Declaration of Independence at his own peril you disgrace the FF of this Republic.  Tell us exactly where that  quote came from, who said it and under what context . He is a political animal which you are attempting to copy and not fooling anyone here although you attempt to disinfranchise some of the timid on this board for exercising their 2A rights. Now why would you abuse the 1A when you have attempted to create a false delimma already about the 2A? Your Progessive/socialist/commie leanings are showing again. He praised Mao as a dictator and tried to demonize people who are pro 2A from keeping and bearing arms as the true masters in our political system.
