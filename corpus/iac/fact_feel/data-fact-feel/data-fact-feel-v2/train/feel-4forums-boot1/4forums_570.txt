I'm still cathcing up with all the posts. I'll respond to them sooner or later.  How do you say they don't have equal right when all have the smae rights. We all ahve the right to marry. The right to marry someone we love is not a right because I'm in love with Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison, Sam Walton's family and all the billionaires. Just because you love someone doesn't give you a right to marry them.  Where do we draw the line wiht behavior?
