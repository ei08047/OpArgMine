It&#8217;s the NRA&#8217;s fault.  Speaking of legislation that would give the citizens of Washington their first vote in Congress since 1801.  We're Stronger for the Voting Rights Battle  We want representation in Congress, However, we don&#8217;t want to be forced Follow ALL of the Constitution! Why? Because being forced to Follow all Constitution, the Supreme Law of the Land, is just plain stupid! I guess.  So, DC wants special treatment to violate the Law. Isn't that the definition of Criminal?  Oh Lord. Please help us!
