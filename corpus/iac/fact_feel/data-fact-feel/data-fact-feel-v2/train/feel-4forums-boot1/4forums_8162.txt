Heck, I'd be proud to have my name there, knowing I was doing the right thing. But I think you may be right; someone needs to report it. What I want to know is, why would they WANT to know where these people live?  That's kind of scary.  (Also, did you notice the obvious marketing appeal-to-sympathy tactics on the page he linked? The man with a baby implying it's his adopted son or something? I can hear the kid a few years from now:  Hey mom, did you know I was used by the gay lobby industry to lie to people and shamelessly solicit sympathy?  Good grief what a sham)
