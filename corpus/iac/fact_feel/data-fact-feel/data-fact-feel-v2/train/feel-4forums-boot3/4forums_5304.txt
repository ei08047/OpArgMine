Truth be told, the mayor is grand standing for the Supreme Court in order to try ans sway their decision to allow them to continue their clearly unconstitutional gun ban! He doesn't want the National Guard any more than he wants a plague to come into the city of Chicago.  He is like a little child holding his breath in hope that he can get what he wants.
