Clearly you have never lived on the streets, and clearly you have never done any kind of study into the social ramifications of being homeless and/or living in constant poverty.  Sure, not every kid that grows up impovrished is going to fall into a cycle of poverty, substance use, low self-esteem, and abuse (physical, emotional, sexual). A lot of them will. Too many of them will.  It is naive and ignorant to tell someone that that kind of life is acceptable simply because they still have the  privilege  of existing.
