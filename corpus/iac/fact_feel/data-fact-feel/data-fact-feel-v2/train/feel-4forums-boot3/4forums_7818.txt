and tell me what did you gain out of making this statement? Just to let you know... the Bible (if you would actually read it in context instead of reading a little portion that you want to and interpret it the way you want outside of its context).. teaches how to love... because God is love.. and laid down his own life so that we could be FREE! hmmm.... sounds like the motto of what our troops do for our country... they lay their lives down because they want us to be free... where do you think this  ideology  comes from???
