You do realize you are asking a question to an issue that has multiple definitions with a pigeonholed response? It is like asking group X whether they support or condemn sex but not defining sex with who, with or when. Most people would respond with a yes but this doesn?t mean they?d condone rape.  To either support or condemn statuary consent laws incredibly depends on the multiple definitions of ?age of consent? provided by the lawmakers.
