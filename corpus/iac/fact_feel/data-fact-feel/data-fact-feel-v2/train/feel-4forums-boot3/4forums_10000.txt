Honey!!! What do you think I was hinting at????  Hmmm...wonder if I could get my partner to actually step onto a plane...  Hey, has TF Green changed all that much in the past fifteen years?  At least I've got some friends I could stay with!!! (and no...I don't mean you...remember I used to live in RI)
