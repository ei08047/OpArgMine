Ill be the first to agree with the saying  If you can...and have the place to...you will  But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.  As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed.
