Pretty close to what we are doing.  It is going to be outdoors, in my boss's backyard (nice area). It will be small, family, friends, 40 people tops. We will have some kind of food, haven't figured that yet. Got a really small budget. We plan on the vows, and rings and our parents doing something.  Lucky for us, we have great friends who want to plan it for us. But some details I feel we should decide.
