The death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else. In prison, the criminal could a) kill another inmate, 2) kill a guard, 3) escape and kill a civilian, 4) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime.  No, for the reasons stated above and one more. Some people don't deserve to live....like SH, for example.
