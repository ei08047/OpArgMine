I might be missing something, but where in the article does it mention information flow reversing? I've been through it a few times and it still seems to be talking about the transcription of DNA, just bits of DNA that don't code for proteins.  At best, I can infer a suggestion that RNA contributes information as well as DNA contributing information, but that's about it. I'm probably just being dense; can anyone help out?
