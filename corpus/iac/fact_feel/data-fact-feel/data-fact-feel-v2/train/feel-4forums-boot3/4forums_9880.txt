A curse? If you don't agree with it that's one thing. Many people have died because of Christianity. The Crusades killed many people just for not converting to Christianity. Gallileo was arrested for proposing the Earth revolves around the sun which was against the church. Atheism hasn't ever hurt anybody. And you call atheism the curse?
