Oh, I'm betting the usage will go up, if only temporarily when it's legalized. I know several people who would be smoking now if it wasn't illegal.  Employers would likely counter this with more testing of employees and applicants.  Users would probably smoke more often and in more places than they now do.  I would become a chain-smoker! LOL
