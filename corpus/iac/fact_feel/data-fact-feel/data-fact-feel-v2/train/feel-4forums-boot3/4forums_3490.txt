You deny what I wrote is your position. Well if your position isn't that  it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against criminals  then logically your position must be that such high capacity magazines are necessary for self defense. But if such magazines would benefit law abiding citizens in an armed conflict then why couldn't they also benefit criminals?
