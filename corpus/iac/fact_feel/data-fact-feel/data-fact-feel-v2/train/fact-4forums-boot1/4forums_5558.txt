Some in S Africa do not think their gun laws are strict enough. Some in New york city do not think THEIR gun laws are strict enough. This just shows that there are XXXXXX everywhere.  In S Africa, you are required to have a permit to own any firearm. Any criminal activity, or  questionable  associations result in the refusal of a permit. Over 60% of permit applications are denied, and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe. YET, unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones.  The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway. Nobody is going to decide NOT to murder somebody because they fear being charged with illegal posession of a firearm.  Gun laws essentially only apply to law abiding citizens. A criminal is, by definition, somebody who does not obey the law. You cannot legislate away criminality.
