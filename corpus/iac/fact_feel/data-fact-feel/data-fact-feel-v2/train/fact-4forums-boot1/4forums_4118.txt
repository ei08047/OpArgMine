Why should he put it in context when even most Christians don't? The majority of Christians in the world are not bible scholars and know very little of its actually history. There are some who even believe that the bible, as a whole, has existed unchanged since the beginning of time. They are really surprised when they find out it has really only existed, as a whole, for around 1600 to 1700 years, and that it has been revised several times with books being added and some removed, and even some edited.
