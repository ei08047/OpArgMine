Actually, I can not accept that claim. Before then, the absolutely youngest ever surviving fetus was deliver at 19 weeks, 6 days. 12 weeks would be a worldwide sensation. I would recommend that you double-check your source. Viability is still defined as the age at which 50% survive, which still is at around 24 weeks gestation/26 weeks pregnancy.
