The 10 commandments are a real time story, told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to... Moses.  Genesis, is a history lesson, told by a man who had no understanding of modern science, or the language to describe it in that fashion... Moses.  If God chose to reveal to you in some special way, the origins of the universe, for you to write down for generations to come.. you would write a different story than Moses. Just as one person views art differently from another person.  I see no duplicity between the two.
