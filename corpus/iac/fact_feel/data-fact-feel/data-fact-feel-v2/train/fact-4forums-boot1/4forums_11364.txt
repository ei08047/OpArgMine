Irrelevant. Even if we assume that accusations of religion's negative influence are misplaced, two wrongs don't make a right. Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related, or they are not. Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion. The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie, which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical.  The classic example is: gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year. This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community. This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work. We must dispel this mythical gravity idea as pseudoscience and replace it in schools with Intelligent Falling theory.
