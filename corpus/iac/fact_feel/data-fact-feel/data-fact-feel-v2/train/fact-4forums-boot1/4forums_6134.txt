Yeah. Funny thing about that.  NONE of what you quoted includes any discussion of money raised...  They organized marches. Yes.  They had phone banks for the purpose of persuading undecided voters. Yes.  But no mention of money raised...  And don't get me wrong. I am against the organizing of marches and the phone banks.  But if we're going to start indicting on that as well, please let me know cause the list of  guilty churches  just got a heck of a lot longer as opposed to just listing ones which had generated  $190,000  directly, and lots more from individual church members.
