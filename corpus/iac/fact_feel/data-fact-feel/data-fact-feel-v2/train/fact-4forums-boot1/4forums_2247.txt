You guys are going WAY overboard on this. The changes to the board of education standards will NOT materially change the way evolution is taught in Kansas, nor does it allow the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in our classrooms.  Our districts scientific advisory board says the changes to the curriculum make it  more factually accurate , and even the folks who drafted the original curriculum could find no factual fault with the new draft.  The chicken littles out there need to get a grip.
