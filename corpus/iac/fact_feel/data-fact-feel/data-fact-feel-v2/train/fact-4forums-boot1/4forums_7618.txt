If we were knowingly executing innocent people, it would be one thing. But the people we execute have been found guilty in a court of law, and are given the opportunity of 8 (i think it is 8) appeals. If after all of this an innocent person slips through the cracks and is executed, so be it. It is tragic, but overall I think the system works well the way it is. I think the deterent benefit of capitol punishment is far too valuable to throw away for rare instances of innocents being executed. Does anyone have any reliable information about how many people have been executed and were later found to be not guilty? I have never found any figures that I would consider to be reliable.
