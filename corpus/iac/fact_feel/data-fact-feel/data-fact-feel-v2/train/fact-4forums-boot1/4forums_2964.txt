To be able to do  anything , including things outside the knowable, is unintelligble. You cannot even being the argument because you are arguing the unknowable, which is, unknowable. That's the root. You can no more argue that god can participate in the unknowable, than you can do any rational examiniation of anything that has the attribute of being unknowable. It's meaningless.  If on the other hand you are starting with the premise that god is some entity that resides in the knowable universe, and is also knowable, then we can discuss this. And then  god  cannot also be the creator of the universe, which means I can probably stop right there in the debate.  Jim's claim of  god is omnipotent and omniscient, is equally nonsensical.  Ominpotence cannot be understood, it's unknowable.  But, to tie this all back into a more useful example:  If God is omniscient, he knows everything that will happen and has happened.  If God is omnipotent, he can do anything.  That's contradictory. If he knows what will happen, then he cannot change what will happen, and is thus, not omnipotent. These are contradictory.  So theists can choose, either to discuss meaningless things (unknowable), or to admit that there is no god by classic definition.  -Mach
