Uh, my point was that gun control has become a different issue since the 1700s, not that it was suddenly a new point.  Grizzly, you say that gun control is 'always the first to go'. Godwin's law aside, what do you think of the Patriot Act and Gitmo? Do they not count as rights being eroded, to you? Or is it simply that you consider your right to bear arms more important that your right to privacy or your right to freedom from imprisonment without trial?
