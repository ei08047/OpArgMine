I believe you are misinterpreting Mr. Madison. James Madison made it clear throughout his writings that a powerful government was something to be worried about and carefully watched.  But, lets say your right. Where do you draw the line? For example: seeing as religion has most likely killed more people than cancer, under your theory, what is to stop government from outlawing organized religion? You once told me you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, would you be willing to give up your freedom of religion to protect other freedoms?
