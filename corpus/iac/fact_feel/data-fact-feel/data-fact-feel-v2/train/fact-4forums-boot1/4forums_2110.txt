Gay pride is positive, unlike what these people are doing. Do you have some information regarding a gay rights ad campaign that can be compared to this one?  I laughed when I first saw the ad on MSNBC's Hardball tonight. It shows the fear, insecurities and the fallacies that guide anti-gay equality rights activists.
