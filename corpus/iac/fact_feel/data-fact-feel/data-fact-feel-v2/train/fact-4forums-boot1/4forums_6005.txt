Premise 1: God lives in another universe (Heaven) and therefore cannot be detected in this universe. (Definition of God)  Premise 2: If something exists, then it can be detected/sensed. (Definition of Existence)  Contrapositive of Premise 2: If something cannot be detected/sensed, then it does not exist.  Conclusion: God does not exist.  The reason that this doens't prove Atheism is that it cannot disprove the existence of, say, the Hindu gods, which are defined as beings in this world that can be seen. It just disproves theism.
