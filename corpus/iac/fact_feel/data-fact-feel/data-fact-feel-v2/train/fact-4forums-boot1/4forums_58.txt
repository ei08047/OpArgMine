Entirely wrong on this point. I was in sierra leone during hte rebellion, nad they did have a working government structure from begining to end. Civilians in rebel controlled portions of sierra leone were hacked apart with machetes (literally) and horribly treated because they had no way to fight back. In several circumstances, entire villages were bypassed by the rebels becasue one or 2 people had ignored the ban on guns. Rebels showed up, took fire from the town, and went and found an easier town to pick on. There was a move by certain british folks who worked for certain british companies to arm the civilian population. Unfortunatly, the UN impoased an arms embargo against sierra leone and short circuited the plan.
