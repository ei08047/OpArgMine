The 1995 book, Sex in America, by Gina Kolata, Edward Laumann, and Robert T Michael, which summarizes the results of the last comprehensive nationwide sex survey in this country, reveals that as many as a fifth of the women surveyed practiced anal sex. (The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex (1991) puts the percentage even higher.)  I think it's logical to assume that the overwhelming majority of these women were neither lesbians nor performing the act by themselves, but with male partners. The figure can therefore safely be extended to the population at large, give or take a few percentage points.  Given that most conservative estimates place the entire gay population of the U.S. at 3-5% (some ultra-right groups place it even lower), taken with the uncontestable facts that 1) few lesbians indulge in penetrative anal sex, and 2) a significant portion of gay men don't either, it becomes clear that, in raw numbers, the number of heterosexuals who are having anal sex far surpasses the number of gay people doing the same.
