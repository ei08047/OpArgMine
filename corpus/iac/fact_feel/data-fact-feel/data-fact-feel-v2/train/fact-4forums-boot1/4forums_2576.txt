Yes, I think so. Why do you ask?  It isn`t. Its 2,0% (est. 2003)...  They do. The appointments in the judicial branch are either political (by a democraticly elected government) or based on merit. The legislative branch is elected through popular elections and the executive branch (the government) is in turn elected by the parliament  Nope. Denmarks political system is based on parliamentarism. The executive power rests in the prime minister, not the monarch (who lacks political power).  Nope, judges are either appointed by democraticly elected governments or hired on merit (depending on what facet of the judicial branch you are talking about).  Well, I`ve always seen denmark to have a rather high level of political, economic, social and religous freedom (the only real detriment is high taxes, but some would argue that high taxes coupled with a large amount of income distribution actualy increases economic freedom, so its kind of ambigous). This being mixed with relative socialistic and prosperous economy makes Denmark a good contestant for the title  the land of the free .
