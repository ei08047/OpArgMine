Yes they are mutually exclusive SD, or else God is a liar. Can't you see that? Tell me how God could have created the Heavens, the Earth and all life as described in Genesis less than 10,000 years ago, AND simultaneously allowed intelligent life to have evolved through random mutation by way of natural selection over a period of billions of years? Explain that massive inconsistency to me in a rational and consistent manner if you can.  The bottom line is that when all is said and done, either ID or evolution will be proven to be 100% wrong. And it won't matter to God at all if the other side is only partially right. But the side that's wrong has had to have erased Him from the equation in order to get to that fallacious conclusion, and that side is evolution which exists for the purpose of offering a secular humanist answer for how man came to be here.
