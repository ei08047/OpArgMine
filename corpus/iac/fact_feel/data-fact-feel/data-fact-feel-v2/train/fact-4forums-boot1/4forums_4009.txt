Was the Bible written by man under inspiration?  If yes, why is it not to be taken literally?  If no, why take cognisance of any of it?  If Jesus existed, was crucified and died for us, why do you take that bit literally when you've already stated the contrary?  What happens to unbaptised infants?  Once baptised, can I murder and cheat and steal? You said I don't have to do anything (for God) because I am under grace (wanted or not). Should I take this literally or not?  What about the Scriptures - He that endures to the end is the one that will be saved, and, faith without works is dead etc. That contradicts your doing nothing.  If that's not a clear-cut case of Christianity on the individual's terms (not God's), then I don't know what is.  Fascinating.
