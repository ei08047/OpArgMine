You sure this is not another Piltdown Man?  A corresponding article in my local paper brought out some interesting points regarding this.  The revision of the fossil's age  makes the date of the fossil record almost exactly concordant with the dates suggested by genetic studies for the origin of our species.   Could this be an example of making the results what we thought they should be?  It puts homosapiens in Africa many thousands of years before our species appears on any other continent.  It strengthens the notion that modern humans lived during much of their history alongside other human species.  The discovery last year of a new and distinct species of pygmy-sized humans on the Indonesian Island of Flores shows that at least two separate species of humans coexisted on the planet as recently as 18,000 years ago.  Boy, won't that raise the hair on the back of a hardcore creationist?
