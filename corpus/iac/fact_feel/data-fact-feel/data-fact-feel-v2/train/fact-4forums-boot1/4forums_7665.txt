I've not honestly watched it yet (have crappy internet connection at the moment, might watch when I go home from Uni), but it could be just die to stimulus/response or a pure reflex. The brain could easily not be involved and its unlikely to be aware of what its doing, if its not just another artefact of the speeding up the film (i.e being poked and moving due to being manipulated but seeming to struggle rather than being moved)  Pro-choice and developmental biologists are quite different, I'd be worried if you had none on the pro-life side of the debate yet all agree on the period of time it takes for certain structures to develop.
