Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.  Perhaps that is because the superstitious mythology of creationism isn't relevant. The fact that scientists have learned something new and that creationists are frightened by it is of no concern. There isn't all that much of a controversy among scientists. They will, of course, do everything they can in an effort to verify these findings, but science thrives on controversy. And, of course, dissent based on superstitious mythology is meaningless. It actually takes evidence. Something that creationists lack.  I guess you weren't paying attention to discussions and didn't read the articles. So we now have the usual creationist evidence against all science,  I just can't believe...
