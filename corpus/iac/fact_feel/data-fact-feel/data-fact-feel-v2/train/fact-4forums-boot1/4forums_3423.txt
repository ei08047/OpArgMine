Oh, I have little doubt that there are more abortions.  I think its pretty clear that legalising encourages abortion: its very hard to support it while saying abortion is murder, while drug legalisation can be supported by people very strongly campaigning against drugs (Mo Mowlam for example, here in Britain).
