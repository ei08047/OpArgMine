Erector sets anyone?  I've never in 5 years on multiple boards seen a user able to hold his own in a science discussion with a theory that cannot be tested. I've however seen a pattern of deliberate ignoring of users who poke holes in their theories though. Apparently they'd rather ignore how they are wrong then fix their problems (yet they criticize the very nature of science).  People say that civilization has advanced. These people make me think long and hard about that.
