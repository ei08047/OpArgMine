As someone who does not believe that every word in the Bible is inspired, I&#8217;ll still debate the subject using the Bible verses. I&#8217;m not stating my belief about abortion in the following, just as I said, debating the verses.  Exodus implies that a fetus is a piece of property that is owned by the husband. Notice the mother has no say in the matter, just the husband who decides the price of the fetus.  The Psalms you quoted is not clear about the subject. It talks about God making the author, not about when he became a human being. And Psalms 22:10 implies that God was his God from the time he was born.  I&#8217;m not sure where Gentiles is in the Bible but the verse you quoted again does not state when someone becomes a human being.  The Bible is not filled with quotes about humanity in the womb. There are a few references about a fetus but nothing that states when a human being begins. Even if you believe you become a human being before birth, the question is, at what point?  You state that a fetus must be a human being. And why, well because you think it must be.  Your last argument is that it must be a human being because it has a human genetic code. Dead people have human genetic code. I don&#8217;t believe they are human beings.  Biogenesis does not address when a fetus becomes a human being.
