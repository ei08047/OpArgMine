Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).  That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science.  Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.
