Yes I do. Anytime there's a mass killing, you and your ilk are holding it up as an example of how we need more gun control, how we have to reduce the rights of the people so those that die won't have died in vain.  There's sufficient evidence to point out that strict gun control does nothing to make anybody safer. According to the article nearly 1,700 people have been murdered in the last three years, in a country with the kind of gun control laws that you have the nerve to claim will make people safer. That's over 560 people in a single year, in a country where gun ownership is exceedingly rare and tightly regulated.  A lot of good your desired regulations have done the victims.  So were the officers on the front lines of the Mumbai massacre. But they didn't shoot back, they hid like cowards. They let people get killed for no good reason.  There's a reason there haven't been any recent large scale massacres in America, despite the high levels of gun ownership.  When was the last time 72 officers were killed in America in a single day, in a specific setting?
