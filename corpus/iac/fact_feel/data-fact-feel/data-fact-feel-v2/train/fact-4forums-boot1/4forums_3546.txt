The 1860 Colt Navy Revolver is a .36 caliber single-action revolver, which means the hammer must be pulled back and released by the trigger for each firing.  It's what's termed a cap &amp; ball pistol, meaning a measure of gun powder is placed in each front opening (6) of a revolving cylinder with a normally round lead projectile 'ball' used to compress the powder. A 'cap' consisting of fine gunpowder encased in a tin cap is placed on a nipple at the rear of each cylinder opening. The revolver hammer is pulled back (cocked), trigger pulled which releases the hammer to fall and crush the cap, which creates a small explosion of fire directed by the nipple to the measure of gunpowder creating a larger explosion which propels the projectile (ball).  These are black powder guns, low velocity and a mess to clean after firing. Lots of websites on the history and and many, many excellent reproductions.
