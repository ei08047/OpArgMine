I heard that Harry Reid will allow Scott Brown to be sworn in before any more health care voting takes place. I just need to know if the liberals can sill find a way to pass this bill without the votes they need and without the support of the American People. Could they say, lie and rush through a vote in the middle of the night before Brown is sworn in?
