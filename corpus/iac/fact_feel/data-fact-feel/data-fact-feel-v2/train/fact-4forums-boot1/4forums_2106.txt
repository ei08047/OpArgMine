Some cancers are due to the environment, many are not. Nearly all are due to either inheriting a set of predisposing genes or to chemical interference with normal genes, or to mutangenic effects of radiation and chemicals. The degree to which man made mutagens causes cancer is not entirely clear except in special cases like vinyl chloride, benzene, and tobacco smoke among others. Environmental controls can only provide some degree of prevention, they cannot cure cancer after its established. Mostly thats done by immune system action - we all get cancer rather often in fact, but it gets killed off before it becomes a problem. That system is of course not perfect and people do often develop serious problems with cancer. The simplest public health improvement would be to eliminate the habit of smoking cigarettes - speaking of billions and billions of dollars! {and I am not even taking heart disease and possibly AZD into account}. By the way we appear to have a good handle on stopping cervical cancer cold in its tracks via vaccination against the relevant viruses.
