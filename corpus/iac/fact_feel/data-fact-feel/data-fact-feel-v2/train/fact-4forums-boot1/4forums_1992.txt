Actually, many people's view of prolife are  colored  by their actions. In the extreme, the bombings and murders (yes, I know most prolife condemnn this, but some don't).  To a lesser degree thet incessant lies on the prolife sites (I bet you are hard pressed to find a major anti-abortion site that doesn't claim abortion causes breast cancer, when this has cathegorically been disproved.)  And then the ongoing denial of the woman as a person in her own right instead of chattel that can be forced to give of her bodily resources against her will.  So no, a single silly outburst by one ignorant poster, be it a teen or not, is not going to change the opinion of PL much.
