Well, next to my keyboard currently is a rather fine bar of Ecuadorian milk chocolate, 39% cocoa solids, make with organic, fairly traded cocoa and raw cane sugar, manufactured in Italy. I also still have the packet for a similar 35% cocoa solids Dominican bar, made in Germany. Have to say that on balance I prefer the Ecuadorian bar, much deeper flavour.  Hershey's is repulsive, and snickers is bland and greasy.  On topic, do US authorities seriously not make provision for burying the dead? UK local authorities are obliged to dispose appropriately of bodies if no-one else is able to make the arrangements.
