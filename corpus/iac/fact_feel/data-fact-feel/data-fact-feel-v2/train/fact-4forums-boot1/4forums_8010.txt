You start off with 'mutation that provides new/useful information'. I provide it - the 'panda gene' is both a new piece of information, and is demonstratively useful (either in the modern world of breed-obsession, or the ancient world where improved camouflage would come in handy). You redefine what you originally asked for into 'mutation that changes a hair into a scale/feather' -something which is highly unlikely to happen with a single mutation.  That's horrific moving of the goalposts.
