I'm referring to your comment about the hip replacement wait times. That has nothing to do with Medicare.  If this is the case than you'd be wise to figure out why this is as opposed to blindly assuming universal healthcare is the answer. For example, cutting 100% of administrative costs would save us nothing and it doesn't address why those administrative costs are even there and if they would go away with universal healthcare and if that would make things better.
