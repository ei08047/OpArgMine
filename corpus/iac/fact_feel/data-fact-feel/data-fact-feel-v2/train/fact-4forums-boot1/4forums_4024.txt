Ah, but then, it might not have been Homer.  But then again, whether it was Homer or someone else, isn't earth shattering.  Much like whether it was Julius Caesar who crossed the Rubicon, or a decoy of his.  Now, if we found an account from Roman times of how Julius Caesar split the waters of the Rubicon by urinating in it so his troops could pass...Occam's Razor would not point towards accepting it as true.  In reading about John the Baptist...should one listen to the Bible, or Josephus?
