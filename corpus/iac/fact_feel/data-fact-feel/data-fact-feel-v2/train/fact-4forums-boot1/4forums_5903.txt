I believe that if abortion should ever become illegal again that the mother should be charged with murder in the first. A fetus is a human from the moment the sperm and the egg meet. If a husband murders his preagnant wife he is charged with murder not only for the mother but for the fetus as well. Not to mention a fetus is murdered in a very brutall way, they dont even get the luxery of being shot or stabbed they get dismembered.
