The Big Bang was proved wrong years ago by Kent Hovind. Here's how:   20 billion years ago there was a Big Bang [what exploded: since the year 2006, scientists have claimed that nothing exploded into the universe! By one of the most famous laws of physics, matter can neither be created nor destroyed. Nothing can't explode into something. Also, where did that something come from? Where did the energy for the explosion come from?] that started as a microscopic dot and exploded and expanded faster than the speed of light. It started out as a very hot, very dense region that was smaller than a period. [As you know, when matter is heated, it expands. For something to be hot enough to explode faster than the speed of light, it would have to be larger than our minds can comprehend.] Eventually, all of the matter in the universe will again be compressed into a infinitesimal speck. [We know that the universe is expanding outward. It cannot possibly expand from light years to something smaller than an atom.] When the universe was a dot, it spun clockwise faster and faster until it exploded. [The Law of Angular Momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment, then the fragments will all spin the same direction. Yet if the universe started out as a spinning speck and exploded, then how is it that the universe is filled with exceptions where moons, planets, and even whole galaxies are spinning backwards?] To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and here we are!'
