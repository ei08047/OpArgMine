Since you redacted my previous statement, I repeat it for your benefit: There is nothing racist about the truth. Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out. That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black. It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law, then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do. Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone, then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat. She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me, she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police. I'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it. This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her.
