No, you just need to the same in proportion to the strength of the animal. Actually you probably need proportionally less to tie down an elephant because they have a worse power to weight ratio. The US, being a bigger country, has more money to spend on this. Also, having a higher population density than Canada would be an advantage, not a disadvantage, in the efficient provision of healthcare. I should also point out that the NHS manages to serve pretty much every area of the UK, including the tiny islands off the coast of Scotland and the remote North West Highlands.
