See, for example, the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh. The gods decide to destroy the world in a deluge. One of them  goes rogue  and warns a man named Utnapishtim. He is advised to build a great boat, and to bring every living thing aboard, which he prudently does. He and his wife and the animals ride out the ferocious storm for seven days and seven nights. Utnapishtim finds that when the rains have stopped, land is nowhere to be found. He releases several birds to no avail, but finally a raven finds dry land. Meanwhile, the god who had originally proposed destroying the world now relents and blesses Utnapishtim and his wife with immortality.  The written version of this story predates the written Judaic tale of Noah. Which isn't to say that the Israelites borrowed the tale consciously or deliberately. Nor even, necessarily, that they  borrowed  it at all: various elements of the tale can be found in sacred stories throughout the Fertile Crescent, and all of them originally appeared in oral traditions, so it's exceedingly difficult to determine which came  first  or to sort out the subsequent lineages. But that the stories are closely connected is clear. And when one considers the historical connections between the Israelites and the Babylonians, it becomes even clearer.
