Well, here is the article from the BBC yesterday. That article puts it here.  Eusthenopteron -> Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  There are other examples of transitionals in the gap where they have placed Tiktaalik. From the age (383 million years), it would have fit in to the sequence like this. Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Elginerpeton -> Ventastega -> Metaxygnathus -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  Of course I do not mean to imply that any of these is ancestral to any other. Venastega, for example, is more primative in form that Acanthostega, and something like Venastega would be expected in the transitional sequence. However, it was almost contemproaneous with Acanthostega.  And I'm not sure where to put Pederpes finneyae. It is apparently not as old as Tiktaalik. It would also date to the same period between Panderichthys and Acanthostega known as Romer's Gap.  Per Ahlberg posted a  hint  about Tiktaalik on the IIDB evolution board on March 30. Two articles and a News &amp; Views piece by Per and Jenny Clack were published in Nature today. NEWS There are pictures in Nature
