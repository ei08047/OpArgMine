Well, I was kind of hoping that my questioning would encourage you to provide a quote to show us exactly what Dembski himself said, but I guess I wasnÂ’t blunt enough.  YouÂ’ve now made it clear that your claim Â– which is still unsupported Â– is that Dembski says a fourth law of thermodynamics, and not the fourth law of thermodynamics. But that still would not necessarily make Dembski wrong.  Does DembkiÂ’s wording show he means a fourth law-of-thermodynamics, or a fourth-law-of-thermodynamics? The first would be wrong but the second would be right.  To try to make this clearer:  ..... We have a zeroth law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a first law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a second law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a third law of thermodynamics.  ..... Dembski claims to have uncovered a fourth law of the thermodynamics.  If his actual statements can be read in that sense, then his claiming to have come up with a fourth law of thermodynamics does not show ignorance, on his part, of their already being 4 laws of thermodynamics.  And as I suggested in my post, here is Stuart Kauffman, who is clearly neither a Creationist nor an ID Creationist, speaking of his attempts to uncover a fourth law of thermodynamics...
