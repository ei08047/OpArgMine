**  Wrong. As always.   The noun atheism has 2 meanings:  Meaning #1: the doctrine or belief that there is no God  Synonym: godlessness  Antonym: theism (meaning #1) [bold added]  Meaning #2: a lack of belief in the existence of God or gods  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **  A  doctrine  is--   A principle or body of principles presented for acceptance or belief, as by a religious, political, scientific, or philosophic group; dogma.   answers.com  Thus atheism is a dogmatic statement of belief, just like any other religion. Most people, BTW, know that by affixing the prefix 'a' to a word, you intend that word's contrary. As in, 'historical'/'ahistorical', 'typical'/'atypical', and 'theist/'atheist'.
