If anyone is pushing ID, YEC is an issue. ID as a  foot in the door  maneuver in an effort to teach science. The problem is that most school boards are made up of Christians who think that their religion is somehow supported by science, and they don't see the harm in teaching their idea of god as science. You seem to fit that picture pretty well.
