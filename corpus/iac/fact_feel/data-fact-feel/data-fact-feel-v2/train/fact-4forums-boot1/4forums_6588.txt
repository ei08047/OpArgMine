Forgive me, I'm new to this. What does  YEC  stand for?  Also, to say that evolution isn't concerned with  beginnings  seems disingenuous to me. Couldn't it as easily be said that change marks the beginning for some species? I would say that evolution most certainly can be used to explain the beginning of many species we know today.
