But private citizens run background checks on other citizens all the time. I rent property. I make sure my tenants aren't felons before I lease anything. I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon. It is just something I personally would choose to do if I didn't know the buyer I was selling to...
