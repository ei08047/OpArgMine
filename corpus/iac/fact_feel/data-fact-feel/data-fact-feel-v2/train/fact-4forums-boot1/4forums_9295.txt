I think you could get by without teaching evolution in schools. I don't think it would be a thin edge of a wedge where kids are only taught things not easily teach yourself. Science still should still be taught and I would say most of it is hard to teach yourself. You can teach genetics and why lamrack ideas were discredited etc.
