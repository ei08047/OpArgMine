This is why the title is  God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.  Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle
