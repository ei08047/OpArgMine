Well nothing at all in the program about the MORI poll, but instead a focus on four prominent figures of ID movement (Johnson, Dembski, Behe, Meyer) and their role in the development of the position over the last two decades.  I think the program makers granted the IDists a remarkably prominent platform on which they could present their views- which they did with a typical evasion of their religious motivations by avoiding any reference to Christianity and trying to present themselves in the guise of scientists (which is true for Behe but not the others.)  Countering their contributions were Dawkins, Attenborough and Miller. Dawkins was typically dismissive of the validity of ID and to the point about the intelletual dangers it poses, Miller countered the arguements of irreduable complexity and the alleged mathematical improbability of evolution and Attenborough made some more reservedl but no less powerful observations on the true nature of the fundementalists agenda.  This was against the backdrop of material on the Dover trial and some stuff on the Vatican's outlook on ID. As often happens with a popular science program examining a contentious issue very little science was examined at all, which is a shame as it is through such analysis that ID is exposed as the pseudo-science it truely is. Also, while the program tried to be impartial it gave considerable interview time to the ID group which failed to convey the weight of opinion against them in mainstream science.  Overall an interesting watch, but a bit of a PR coup for the IDists, IMO.
