Want to bet how fast a creationist here is going to try change the subject?  It's still a valid point though. You don't see the kind of anti-evolution bull**** posts on the reviews for textbooks like you do for political/religious books. And this applies to other online sellers too. That to me says that creationists aren't going to respectable sources to learn about a theory they declare false, instead getting their information from politics and religion. Going through Campbell's biology 7th and 8th editions, people are moaning about high costs, poor structuring, and how heavy the book weighs.  Interesting how those who decry evolution don't take their argument to the textbooks that teach it.
