Well, you could try actually reading the second of my two links - there's three relevant sources provided in that post, one of which cites a further two studies. 'Baseless' and 'wild', it ain't.  What's that?  Wild west! Wild west! ? But I digress...  You appear to be exaggerating my position, exactly as I suggested a pro-gunner would likely do; in my very first post in this thread. The fact that guns don't trigger aggressiveness to the extent you exaggerate doesn't change the fact that they do increase it by a measurable amount.
