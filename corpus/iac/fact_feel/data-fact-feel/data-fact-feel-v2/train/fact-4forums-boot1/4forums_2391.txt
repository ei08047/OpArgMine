Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)  Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.  And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't  proven  anything.  The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.  Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.  The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.  There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians.  Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.  But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?  Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?  Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.  Yes, of course the past can never be proven.  But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.  We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.  * - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)
