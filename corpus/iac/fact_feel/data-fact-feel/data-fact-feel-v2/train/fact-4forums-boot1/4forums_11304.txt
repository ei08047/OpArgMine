Well some call me liberal (VoR anyone?) and I am definately pro-choice, I'll chime in here. I completely agree that in Roe v. Wade they made the wrong decision. I think ammendment X comes into play here. Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for the federal government to make restrictions based on abortion. This should be up to the states. Now on that same note it is also unconstitutional for the federal government to make a law banning abortion. This is a law that should be addressed by the states as it is not resered to the federal government.
