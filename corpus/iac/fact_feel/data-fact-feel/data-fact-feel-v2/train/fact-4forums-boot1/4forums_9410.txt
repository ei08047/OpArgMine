That is why scatter charts - such as the one that Adept produced - show figures per 1,000 population or whatever. It makes the data between countries directly comparible. A higher percentage of Americans are murdered every year than in any other  western  country save for N. Ireland (a region wracked by decades of near civil war, military occupation and terrorism).  Can you back up this claim?  Not true. The highest level of crime recorded in Florida was in 1988, the year after the concealed carry law was passed.  You have no evidence to back up that claim at all.
