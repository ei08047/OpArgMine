And quote supposedly a former Justice who ignores the fact that one man = one vote. The NRA doesn't get to vote and just like guns, people vote and people kill people sans guns. Death by any firearms is far down the list! Attempting to move a fundamental right to the top of the list is ill advised and dangerous to a free people and the nation as a whole.
