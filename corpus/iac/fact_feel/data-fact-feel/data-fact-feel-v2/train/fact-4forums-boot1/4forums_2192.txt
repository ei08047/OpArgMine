I suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti DP stance. The rate of recidivism that produces dead innocent victims by paroled criminals far out weights the number of executed innocent men. fix the judicial system. Make lawyers and law enforcement accountable for the errors that lead to deadly mistakes. Quit making future victims pay for incompetence in law enforcement. Dead murderers do not murder again. Tugging at heart strings over the death of a murderer or the terror he feels on the way to the chamber gets no response. No joy, no sorrow.
