The response has to be proportionate to the threat. The Eighth Amendment specifically forbids excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishment; your proposal that all guns be regulated in a manner best fitting machine guns qualifies as both excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishment.  You're really setting yourself up to fail with this argument of yours. Your suggesting that more guns be regulated like machine guns and destructive devices, is like coming out and claiming that the smallest of handguns, is as dangerous and deadly and destructive in power as a belt-fed, fully automatic, .50 caliber machine gun.  When you argue this you're revealing what we already know about you; you hate all guns, and you don't want anybody to own a gun, ever.
