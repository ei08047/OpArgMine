I think VTs reason for posting that video was to show that this 12 year old girl has more wisdom regarding abortion, and sensitivity to human life than most adults possess today. And she rightfully pointed out the true and very real downsides of what abortions represent for the women who get them. She showed that the human misery of killing more than a million unborn babies a year goes much deeper than just the babies that die from abortions. they affect the mother emotionally as well as her future  wanted  children in many cases.
