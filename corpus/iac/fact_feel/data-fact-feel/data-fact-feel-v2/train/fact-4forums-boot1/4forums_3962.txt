Smoking indeed. High carb diets probably not - high fat yes esp colon cancer {so we think}, low-nutirition does not mean much so I wont respond, as I said some environmental mutagens man-made and otherwise, mental health? I don't know of any direct link to cancer for that. Environmental  toxins  are often carcinogenic because they induce mutations for most practical purposes random ones. Smoking is much the same. And many cancers are literally the result of bad luck - a passing cosmic ray for example. I would also add that many cancers also require more than a single mutation and two hits or more are required to produce the disease. Epigentic effects are of course another form of mutation.
