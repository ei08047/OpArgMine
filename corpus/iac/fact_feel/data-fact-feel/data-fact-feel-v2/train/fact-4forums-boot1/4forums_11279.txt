Maybe some of the Homophobes who are in fear of 'brother-sister-', 'animal-human-' or 'plant-stone-' marriages should remember that there is a biological reason why incest is forbidden.  So it is nonsense to see the gay-marriage as a step towards that direction.  Even in liberal European countries where homosexuals are allowed to marry, there arenÂ´t even attempts to allow other forms of marriage; not even marrying 2 or more women.
