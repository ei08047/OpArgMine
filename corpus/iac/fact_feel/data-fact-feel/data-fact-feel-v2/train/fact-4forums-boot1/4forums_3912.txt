I personally believe in science because there is more evidence of it than there is of creation. Science is obviously based on multiple key assumptions, but creation is based on a lot more.  The link is GREAT.  However:  Someone who does evil things isn't simply not doing good things, he is specifically doing evil. Evil is not the absence of good.
