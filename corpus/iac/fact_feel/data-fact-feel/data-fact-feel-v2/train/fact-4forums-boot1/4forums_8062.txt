Bertvan: Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesnÂ’t see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system. Most people do see a difference. The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable. On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as Â“temperature and embryonic dietÂ” might cause proteins to fold differently and thus Â“whip upÂ” complex systems such as Â“eyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shellsÂ” .
