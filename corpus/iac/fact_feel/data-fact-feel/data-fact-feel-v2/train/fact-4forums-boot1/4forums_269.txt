No they are'nt. DNA of gametes is haploid, where as the stomatic cells of the mother and father are diploid. Also, egg and sperm DNA is jumbled, meaning it genes are swapped along chromsosomes, resulting in very different combinations then exist in the original stomatic cells. No, you're wrong, the DNA of the egg and father have many of the same genes as the mother and father, but lack 1/2 of the same genes as well as the same placement.
