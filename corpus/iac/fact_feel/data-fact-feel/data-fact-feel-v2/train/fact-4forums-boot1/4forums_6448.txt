Inference is part of the scientific method -- probably the most important part, at that. Without it we would discover nothing, for we can prove very little to begin with. Bear in mind that  proof  is an extremely high standard. Proof is the level at which a proposition's truth value is necessary (ex: given how we define  two,  it is impossible for  two  to not be  one  plus  one ). Inference on the other hand is the only option outside of mathematics. With that in mind, the fact that we can't prove much of anything is more or less irrelevant; what we can do is find lots and lots of supporting evidence and safely infer information from it.
