Here's my guess:  If would think that repeated attempts such as these found nothing or found something contrary to what was predicted, this could be considered failure of the hypothesis' and hence the theory's predictive value. I don't really know (or if anyone could estimate) what the probability of finding such a fossil would be. If it is highly unlikely in thew first place (and failure of fossils to fossilize is one thing that makes this more unlikely) then a single instance of finding nothing, would not really falsify much. Even so, I don't see how this means that finding something is not a validation.  Actually, I know next to little about the processes involved in paleontological research, so maybe I am speaking out of my elbow in this post. I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance.
