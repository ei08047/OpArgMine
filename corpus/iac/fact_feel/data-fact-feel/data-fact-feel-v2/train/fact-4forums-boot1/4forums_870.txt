How about the reverse: How does providing all the benifits of marriage to homosexual couples by granting civil-unions instead of marriages descriminate against them?  An example: legal guardians perform the same role of parents, except the arrangement is a legal one instead of a genitic one.  Loving couples should be able to be recognized by the government, but the use of the religious term offends many people.  Seperate but equal? Maybe. Almost all sports are separated between men and women - because, while the rules may be the same, there is a fundamental difference between those groups.  Regards
