Well, I thought I did. Perhaps you didn't understand.  We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is. We can also determine other things, such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies. If I were to cut down a tree just after it was  created,  I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons.  In the same way, if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away, we are seeing the events that happened at that star 10 billion years ago.  If this creationist  response  is correct, and the light we see didn't originate 10 billion years ago, what is the light telling us? It's telling us a story of stellar events that never happened. That's like writing a history book about events that never took place... Or at the very least, that would be like someone reading my daily journal of the events that took place in my life millions of years before I was born.  Unless you can explain why we would see this false information, this response leaves you stuck with a trickster God.  Moreover, true to SkepticGunt's word, this view is unscientific because it is completely unfalsifiable.  Because that's how God made it  is not a scientific claim.
