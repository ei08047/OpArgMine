I can't help but wonder if current majority public sentiment against alternative lifestyles, and other change, isn't a portion of widespread fear as that public experiences declines in standards of living, an ongoing threat of Islamic extremist attacks and other social changes that further threaten their status quo. Change is not something eagerly embraced by a majority of the general public under normal circumstances, actually quite the opposite, and these trying times would increase their desire to hold established values representing better times in a higher light than if times were prosperous and stable. Most arguments against alternative lifestyles that I've read are mythological belief system based and present more of a position against the unknown, adherence to parameters established by that belief system, than any disruption of society. Sort of a 'no atheists in foxholes' wartime crowd mentality as versus live and let live if a change presents no threat to the individual (believer) in better times.
