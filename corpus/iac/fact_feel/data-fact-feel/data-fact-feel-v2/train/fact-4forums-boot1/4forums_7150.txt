Actually, no, my understanding is that in most states the law doesn't require this at all. Many doctors take what is known as the Hipocratic oath, but it's not a legally binding oath. Doctors may be subject to personal lawsuits, but that's not the same thing.  Also, the fact the church you mentioned owns a  beachside pavillion  has nothing to do with much of anything. If the church truly owns it, they can refuse any ceremony they want. That it has been  open to all for years  carries no weight whatsoever. It is church property--which is essentially the same as a church saying it doesn't want gay ceremonies in its sanctuary which churches are free to refuse. Maybe churches are imposed upon in such ways in Canada, but not in the US.  Given these matters, I'm not sure the HRC is being any more honest than the video they are responding to.
