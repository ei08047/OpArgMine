In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole  let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it  mentality....
