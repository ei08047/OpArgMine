Yes I do, but because of time restraints and for lack of a better example that everyone could relate to and understand I used it. There are plenty of good examples of where people believe one thing was true while - infact - something else was true, so the point still stands. A better example (that I probably should have used instead) is that people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe, etc. etc.
