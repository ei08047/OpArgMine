Just to repeat what I think others are saying, when we talk about the  single common ancestor  of all life, we are not speaking of an individual, but a population of organisms belonging to a single species.  Nor is this to say that there weren't other species existing at this time -- just one of them left descendents that are still extant.  And some current theories suggest that there may not have been a single ancestral species, at least not in terms of our genetic heritage. I believe that there is some belief that  lateral gene transfer  was a huge component of evolution way back when, mixing up the lineages quite well.
