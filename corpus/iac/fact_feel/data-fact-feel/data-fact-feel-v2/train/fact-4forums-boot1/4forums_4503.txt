This thread started with a challenge to God's omnipotence. It had nothing to do with omniscience. Our definition of omnipotent is  having virtually unlimited authority or influence. That appears to rule out the ability to do every conceivable task, uncluding those that are illogical. It does not diminish the power of God.
