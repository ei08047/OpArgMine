It depends upon the extent to which those two things (YEC and 'the science of geology') clash.  If, for example, you think that oil is in the ground because God put it there 6000 years ago, for us to find and fill up the atmosphere with, there's not much reason to be concerned with things like 'which rock type oil is normally found in'.
