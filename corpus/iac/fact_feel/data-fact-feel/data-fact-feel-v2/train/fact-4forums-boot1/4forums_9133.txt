I think it's hipocritical for pro-lifers to call themselves pro-life except for rape. It's either a child or it's not. If it is a child, then no matter what, the child must survive, becuase it has every right to. If the fetus isn't a child, then we can do whatever the hell we wnat with it. But it's a child, since humans only produce children, and not being of other speices, in accordance to the Principle of Biogenesis. Therefore, abortion is wrong in all cases.
