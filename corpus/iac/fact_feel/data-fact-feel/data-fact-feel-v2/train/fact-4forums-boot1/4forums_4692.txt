Hi 44j, welcome to the forum. The fact is imo, that there is nothing productive, economical or efficient about this Government program. When all is said and done, it will be about rationing healthcare to the american people and concentrating the most effort toward the young. The old will ultimately be sacrificed at the alter of economic efficiency with this brave new world of socialized medicine. We are seeing examples of it today through medicare on a smaller scale than will be practiced once this new program is enacted if we allow it to be.
