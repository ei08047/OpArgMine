I would like to request that this not count as one of my posts. I would like my opponent to tell me what happenstance origins exactly are. A simple link or definition please. Nothing major, this shouldn't be part of the debate, just a definition of the term. A google search for that term gets 2 results, both the same theology forum.  And to the judges/moderator, if this type of request is out of line then please simply delete this post. I'll make my request for a definition in my next post. But I feel it's in the best interests of this debate to allow me this post for simply requesting a definition and him a post for simply pasting a definition.  Thanks.
