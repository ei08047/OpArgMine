But you can drink and drive, you just cannot be intoxicated over a certain limit and drive. There is no test possible in the field (like a breathylizer used for alcohol) that would allow for testing of THC levels. It should be like anything else, if you are causing a problem or showing visible signs of impairment, you get detained and taken for further testing, which they can actually draw a THC level on you in a lab. And since you bring it up, marijuanna does not slow down reaction times near as much as alcohol. Alcohol is far more physically impairing than even high doses of THC.
