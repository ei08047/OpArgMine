Sinjin this appears to be a typically Liberal response to a man who is clearly in trouble. Have you or any of your family ever had to sit with a shotgun on your lap when you should have been peacefully sleeping? The man went to the ball game but was not allowed to return to his home. And for what reasoning? It is his home for goodness sake.  The article is rampant with I feared for my life, I am being harassed, I fear for my family, and the police don't care. That is what struck me when I read this! I was horrified for them just reading it, because I too was in that exact same position once.
