No, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines have bounds. Biologists don't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth. However the universe came into being doesn't affect the theory of evolution. However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution. The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution. I don't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point.......
