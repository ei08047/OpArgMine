I have to admit that I agree with Arch for the most part on this one. There are people in the world that believe a fetus is a human being but also believe in a womans right to choose, I am one of them. I can't be in denial so much as to convince myself that a fetus is not a real human being, of course it is. However, knowing that does not mean that I am against abortion. I think that most sensible people would agree with this perspective. Anybody who says that a fetus is not a person needs to get their head out of their XXX.
