What are you talking about? I thought we were talking about changes in allele frequencies and differential reproductive success, and you barf out some nonsense about information and molecules to man. What does that mean? How is that applicable to evolutionary theory? Are you a parrot or can you actually define information. Are you talking about Shannon information? Yaukey information? What do you mean when you say  information.
