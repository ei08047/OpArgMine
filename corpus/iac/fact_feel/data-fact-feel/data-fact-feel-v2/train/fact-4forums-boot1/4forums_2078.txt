That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.
