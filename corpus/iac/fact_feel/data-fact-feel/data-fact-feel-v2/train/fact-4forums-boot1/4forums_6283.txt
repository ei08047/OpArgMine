Actually, I looked at the sight rather thoroughly, and I was unable to find any real mention of  sensible  gun policies. But then I looked deeper and found out why. This is simply a marketing ploy by the Brady Center aimed at the religious crowd, so the  sensible  policies that they support are really just the same policies that the Brady Center puts forth. Just another way of reaching out to a different demographic.
