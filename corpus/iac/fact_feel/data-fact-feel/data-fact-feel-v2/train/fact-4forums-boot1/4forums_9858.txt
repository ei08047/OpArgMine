the entire creation argument is a load of pure, undiluted ********.  People like Peddler are perfect examples. If evolution is wrong, therefore creation is right in their logic. When was the last time you saw a creationist explain their belief without attacking evolution?  NEVER.  Creationists cannot defend their beliefs because their beliefs are based on known lies.
