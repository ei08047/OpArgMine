Say what? You cannot say for certain that anything would have happened. For all we know if the kids in the classroom had guns they could very well have started shooting and then how do the other students know which one is the real threat? After all, all of them are shooting fellow students, right? So how do they know who the shooter is if EVERYONE is shooting? Who knows what kind of massive gun fight such a thing could turn into.  I support gun rights as much as the next person. But having them in a school environment is just plain ridiculous.
