You would think from Adams words that all one need do to say cure diabetes is to decide that it would be profitable to do so. Problem is that cures can only be found with knowledge and fundamental knowledge at that. Diabetes is NOT a simple dise ase and its likely we do not know enough yet to cure it. MAYBE stem cells are a partial answer, but they will only be partial, maybe genetic modification is part of the answer (insulin resistance and all that). Maybe prevention (how?) is the answer. Maybe the answer is something we have not imagined yet. Maybe there is no ONE answer. These are not simple problems and while diet and exercise are useful and to be highly recommended they will not prevent all diabetes or any other disease. One thing is certain if reseach on the problem is not funded adequately progress will be minimal.
