And that remark is relevant because? Just to inform you once again, the word is  stasis.  You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you can't even spell correctly. However, stasis is the norm in a stable environment. The reasons are simple. Organisms tend to become well adapted to a stable environment. As Richard Dawkins would explain, they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment, and when that environment undergoes rapid change, they go extinct. The fossil record is full of such examples. Dawkins used the analogy of climbing a mountain of adaptation that made it impossible for the organism to cross to the peak of the new environment. Try reading  Climbing Mount Improbable  for an understanding.
