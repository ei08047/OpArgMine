Actually our school's Gay-Straight Aliance held a day of silence to show respect for gays who have had to live in silence. They asked the teachers to respect the people in their day of silence and not force them to talk. I think most teachers didn't force students to talk. Unfortunately, some just spoke in sign language for fun and said they were doing it as part of the day of silence.
