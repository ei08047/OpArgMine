Evolution  Read slowly for comprehension.  Evidence from Living Organisms   If species change over time, then scientists should be able to cite examples showing that a group of living species may have come from a common ancestor. Let us examine one of many cases for which this seems to be true. Gracing the islands of Hawaii is a family of birds commonly called the Hawaiian honeycreepers. All Hawaiian honeycreepers have similarities in skeletal and muscle structure that indicate they are closely related. However, each of the Hawaiian honeycreeper species has a bill specialized for eating certain foods. Scientists suggest that all 23 honeycreeper species apparently arose from a single species that migrated to Hawaii.   Aren't these  new  parts?  http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Hawa...eycreepers.gif
