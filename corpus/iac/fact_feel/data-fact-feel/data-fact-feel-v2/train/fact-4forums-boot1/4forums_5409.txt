Because you don't deny the truth of its claims. If you present the Bible as a credible source, then I can use it to eviscerate your position. Suppose I tell a multi-part story where King ABC is said to never lie, yet in one part, King ABC lies his little crown off. Either King ABC lied in that story and therefore doesn't never lie, or King ABC really doesn't ever lie and in fact didn't lie in that part. You can't have it both ways, but the Bible tries to have it multiple ways all the time. Even if you and I both think that the King ABC story is fiction, we can recognize this inconsistency and have absolutely no reason to believe that the story is nonfiction.  Later you accuse me of having double standards. This is ripe considering the above.
