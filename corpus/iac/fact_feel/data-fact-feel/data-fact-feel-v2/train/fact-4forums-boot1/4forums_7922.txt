The original paper is here. Dr. Schweitzer uses an ostrich egg to compare the structure and layout of the vessels. The chicken comes in from a reacting factor that showed a reaction in the presence of the subfossil 'collagen' material. He hasn't changed it on this occasion, he's just not able to read context....  Oh, by the way AA, are you planning on replying? Or do you cede that fossil discussion?
