So all the creatures you see today came about suddenly and fully formed?  And you observed this?  If this happened, the only one who couldobserve it is God.  Most cambrian fossils don't have eyes.  And there are pre-cambrian fossils.  No, you said that all creatures appear suddenly and fully formed.  Ok, if 365.24... days per year is perfect order then anything can be perfect, eh?  What signs are you talking about? Omens? Astrology now?  Verse? or passage? Where does it say this?  So do 25,000 year old cave paintings.  It says not one word about fossils.  And there are plenty of fossils that have nothing to do with being  laid down by water . Some were buried in tar pits or trapped in amber, etc...  ????????????????  It predicts that people will work on the sabbath and that men will lay with men and men will divorce their wives. SO????  Whatever.  Now here is where you'll have to show some verses and then wait to be laughed out of here.  Nowhere in the old testament is there any reliable prophecy that predicts the nature or timing of Jesus.  For starters, I'd like to direct you to a thread on another board that spells it all out.  http://www.evcforum.net/cgi-bin/dm.c...&amp;f=1&amp;t=332&amp;m=1  http://www.evcforum.net/cgi-bin/dm.c...&amp;f=1&amp;t=334&amp;m=1  Almost but not quite all?  It has been observed to change one kind of plant into another.  Yeah, evidence for natural selection is so routine it has become boring.  Yup, lifeforms in the millions.  Way too many to fit on a boat.
