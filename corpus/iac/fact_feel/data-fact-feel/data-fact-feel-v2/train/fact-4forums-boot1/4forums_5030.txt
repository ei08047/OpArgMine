The US government would open themselves up to insane criticism throughout the world if they banned all guns and spit on the constitution like that. There is no way this will ever happen. Also I don't think the government would want to have our people without guns. They will do what is in their best interest and it is in their interest to have a well armed population to serve as a last line of defense if we ever were to be invaded. I would expect that what is happening in Iraq right now would happen on a much larger scale if anyone ever invaded the US. That alone is a great deterrent to the US ever being invaded regardless of the size or strength of our army. So even on hard times I would expect that the government only support the right to bear arms.
