1) you're assuming that all Christians are biblical literalists  2) you are ignoring the fact that these people are specific people chosen by god (as the link points out)  3) you are ignoring the fact that Psalm 139 saying 'All the days ordained for me were written in Your Book before one of them came to be' suggests that whether you are aborted or not is God's plan anyway.  4) you are assuming that God knowing or making someone makes them a human being: doesn't God know plants, and make and measure the sea?
