I'm always interested in arguments where 'image' assumes physical likeness. When God said, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness...', I wonder why God needs five fingers, two eyes, a heart, liver etc. He's supposed to be a spirit and therefore has no need of physical characterisitics. Easily understood when man created his own god.  But what if 'image' refers to character and personality, not physical appearance? Man really is like his god in that case: murderous, jealous, petty, genocidal, caring, loving, contrary et al. Like father, like son.  Character-wise, man has probably always been the same to some extent or other.
