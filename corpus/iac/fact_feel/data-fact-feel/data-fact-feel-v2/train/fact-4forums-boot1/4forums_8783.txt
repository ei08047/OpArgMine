I doubt it. They know the TROOTH and will refuse to be confused by facts.  How about the Herto skulls? Herto skulls (Homo sapiens idaltu)  So it seems that the gap between 500,000 years and 100,000 years is being filled. Now we have Homo erectus, H. ergaster, H. antecessor, Homo heidelbergensis (archaic H. sapiens), H. ??? (Gawis, Afar, Ethiopia), H. sapiens idaltu, H. sapiens sapiens.  This seems to lend even more support to the Out of Africa II hypothesis. H. heidelbergensis has been found in Africa, Spain, and Europe and is believed to be ancestral to H. neanderthalensis. Late H. heidelbergensis are very much like early Neandertal fossils. But H. heidelbergensis in Africa seems to have led to H. sapiens through the above lineage, followed by migration through the Levant into Europe.  Of course, there is the very real (probable) possibility that I am jumping the gun a bit on this. I hate that  missing link  press gush.
