Tyranny? What happened to Germany a few years after it legalized gun ownership? Hitler rose to power. Ownership of firearms was common in Iraq while Hussein was in power and didn't stop Hussein from being a tyrant.  NYC has also experienced a lot of decreases in crime in recent years. Utah (one of the most pro-gun states) has a higher rape rate than places like New York and California. I have yet to see any smoking gun that guns deter crime.
