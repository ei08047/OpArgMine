And how do you propose to settle this once and for all unless you admit that in order for the egg and the sperm to come together and form a child in 9 months that original life existed within each of them. Not only that, but the resulting offspring is a combination of the features and characteristics of the two parents who copulated. To imply that an unborn child is not human/a person simply because it isn't fully developed is to also claim that a person born without limbs must not be human either because they too are incomplete human beings.
