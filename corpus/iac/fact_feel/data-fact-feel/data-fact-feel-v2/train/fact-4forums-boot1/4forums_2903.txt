Questions I asked in a previous post, but to which I have never received a reply:Does God have genitalia? Why would he? To what possible purpose?  Does He have legs and feet? Why? What does he have to walk on?  How about nipples? A navel? A digestive tract? An anus? Lungs? Why would a non-corporeal being need any of these?  Why would an all-seeing being have eyes that limit him to seeing only forward as we do, especially before he'd even created Light?  God was made in Man's image, not the other way around.
