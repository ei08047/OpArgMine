As a Christian who accepts evolution as fact, I think it is great that Kansas has gone back to teaching actual science instead of religious delusions of the IDers. And the claim of evolution being  just a theory  shows how much you know about science. Gravity is just a theory, do you accept that? There is Nuclear theory, do you claim the atomic bombs never went off in Japan?
