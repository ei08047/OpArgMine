For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad.  If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.
