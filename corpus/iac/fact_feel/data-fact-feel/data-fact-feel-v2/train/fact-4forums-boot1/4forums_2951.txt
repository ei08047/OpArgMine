Whether this has anything to do with marriage or not, it is deplorable that A PERSON who loves another person should be denied a hospital visit for any reason other than concerns related to health. The hospital staff erred in denying the visits, especially those of the children. The denial of the partner's bedside visit is also deplorable. There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party. If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them, it should certainly be permitted.  I think the hospital staff should be chastised and punished to the point of remembering this incident forever as a reason to relax their prejudices and get with the program. There is nothing wrong with gay/lesbian people that love and understanding cannot cure.
