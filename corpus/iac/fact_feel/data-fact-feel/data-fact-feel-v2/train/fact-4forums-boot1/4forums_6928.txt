 Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?   I can't speak for everyone but they all have the capability to have an interest in living. A fetus simply doesn't.  Is there something you are trying to prove? Because I have seen this comparison a thousand times and have disproven it a thousand times over.
