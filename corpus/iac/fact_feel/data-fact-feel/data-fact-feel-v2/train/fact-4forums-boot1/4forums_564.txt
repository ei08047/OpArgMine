OMG. Here we go again.  Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. What theory of law would you use to support your point?  Hypothetical situation: Roe is overturned, returning control over abortion to the states. State  A  bans abortions; state  B  permits them under most circumstances.  1. What sanction does State  A  put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor?  2. How does state  A  prevent its citizens from traveling to state  B  to have the abortion performed?  3. How will state  A  determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state  B  to have the abortion performed?  4. Can state  A  punish one of its citizens for traveling to state  B  to have a legal act performed on her?  5. By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question?  After you finish those, Joel, I have a few more for you.
