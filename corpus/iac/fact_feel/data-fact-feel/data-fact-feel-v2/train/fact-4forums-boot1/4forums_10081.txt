Well, if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct (and don't quote me on this), then some of those things are actually possible. However, as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you, just because something is possible doesn't mean it's definite. I don't see any proof of those things happening any time soon, either, but they're fun to think about, aren't they?
