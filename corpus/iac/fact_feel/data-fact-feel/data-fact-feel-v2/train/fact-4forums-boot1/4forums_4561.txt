I'd more describe it in terms like trebor's. It is a very interesting find though, and it adds more knowledge to our understanding of how the ear formed. From  our  point of view (as mammals) it shows how the original land vertebrate ear developed and we can then see how further modification over time (the development of the mammalian jaw) lead to the development of the mammalian ear with its three bones- an excellent example of how evolution works by modifying existing structures into new forms.
