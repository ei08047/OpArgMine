This focus on consciousness as constituting personhood is completely unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. First, a single human varies in consciousness. I have become much more aware of my world as I have aged. Would it be less moral to have killed me as an infant or a child than now at age 39? Or should you wait until I'm a senile 80 year old to minimize the immorality of killing me? Should you wait until I am daydreaming or asleep since I am less a person at those moments?  Second, humans vary from person to person, and even person to animal. Is it moral to kill a person in a coma, a little immoral to kill a retarded person, and the gravest evil to kill a genius? A mature sheepherding dog is more conscious than an infant--does that mean it's more immoral to kill the dog?  Third, consciousness is just subjective experience of all those neurons firing away in the brain, like a lightning show. It is the epiphenomenon of a BIOLOGICAL reality. Twenty-first century people are still like primitives in that they all-too-often think that humans are like disembodied spirits. The truth is that humans are living BODIES. The Left and the Right join hands in superstition on this one. The biology can exist without consciousness; consciousness CANNOT exist without the biology. Therefore, biology has the stronger claim.
