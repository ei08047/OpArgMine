I can see how these things might be confusing. He's talking about intelligence at the cellular level. I cannot fathom a single-celled or even a small multi-celled being having any intelligence whatsoever. To me, intelligence implies a processor with sensors and outputs based solely on the information received resulting in some action by the intelligent being...ie a brain. Becoming agitated or sloth by heat, pressure or chemicals does not appear to require intelligence.  The survival of the 'cheating' bacteria is a happenstance mistakenly attributed to some deliberate action on the part of the survivors...I think.
