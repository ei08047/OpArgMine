Open your eyes  It already has happened  The U.S. gun industry sold at least twenty-five 50 caliber sniper rifles to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, a study released by the Violence Policy Center (VPC) today reports. The study, Voting From the Rooftops, details the tremendous power of the Barrett M82A1 50 caliber sniper rifles&#65533; which U.S. Marines used in the Gulf War to knock out Iraqi armored vehicles from 1,750 yards away&#65533;and the gun's potential use to commit terror acts that could cause enormous casualties. The Barrett sniper rifle has spawned a bourgeoning market for these types of weapons that are becoming cheaper, lighter and more widely available. There are known to be at least fifteen 50 caliber sniper rifle manufacturers&#65533;nearly double the number of companies that were manufacturing and marketing 50 calibers to civilians in1999.   We can be shocked, but not surprised that the gun industry would sell these dangerous military weapons to Al Qaeda,  said the study's author, Tom Diaz, VPC's senior policy analyst.  These 50 caliber sniper rifles are ideal tools for terror and assassination.
