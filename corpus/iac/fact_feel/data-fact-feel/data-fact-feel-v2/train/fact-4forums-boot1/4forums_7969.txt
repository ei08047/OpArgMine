Responsible contraceptive use is indeed less exciting of a topic to debate than abortion. The only debates that do occasionally arise occur when someone on the pro-life side suggests abstinence only education, and is then attacked by those on the left. I am glad to see that there are many on the pro-life side that agree that abstinence only education might not work. I genuinely believe that better sex education in the schools and a cultural stress at keeping sex safe would go a long way in reducing unwanted pregnancies. Now that AIDs is not as dangerous, it seems that there is less of a cultural push for safe sex than there used to be - since condoms preventing spread of AIDs could also prevent unwanted pregnancies.  Anyway, this topic will unfortunately likely die out. At least it was worth a try.
