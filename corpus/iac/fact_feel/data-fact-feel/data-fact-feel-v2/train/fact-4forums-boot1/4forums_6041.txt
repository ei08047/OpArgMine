It's these reasons that the Health/Wealth prosperity cults have gained in popularity. Where statements are taken out of context from the bible and applied to todays Christianity. It's why Joel Olsteens book, Your Best Life NOW and other such works are so popular.  Kingdom Now theology is quite popular and many according to current polls believe a follower is supposed to live in abundance (meaning financial things...no longer spiritual).  The Word of Faith movement (coupled with versions of Pentecostalism that accounts for about 500 million followers the world over) would be the epitomy of this scam that can't possiblly work.  Many believers also blindly defend their 'mand ob gawd's' prosperity citing that he's to get a 'double portion of honor' and have little problems when that pimp in pastors clothing lives in multi-million dollar homeS while driving several high end vehicles and being cheuffered about by armor-bearer body guards.  They miss the fact that they don't practice what they preach. Sow a seed and harvest a blessing later. That's what they extolle their followers to do. In fact, these vultures live off of their followers seed. (seed nearly always being financial).  Just recently another scandal broke out with Oral Roberts leadership in regards to these abuses.  But, if you have only an average (or less) intellect and no biblical knowledge, you could easily be duped into following these perversions of piety. They practice the most finely tuned of psychological manipulation techniques gleaned from skilled market research.  @Winston...  Even the 'widow lady had 2 coins to give'...and she did.  And you don't need money for NEEDS, like food...send that in too. Be a gooood christian.
