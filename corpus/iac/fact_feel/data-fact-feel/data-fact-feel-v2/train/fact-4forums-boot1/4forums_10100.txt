No you didn't. All you did was spam your same argument your originally made. Notice that as the same argument I pointed out results in a liar God. A god that made the universe very different from the universe we see today and hid all of the operating physical laws that were different along with all of the evidence. As your own link cites, your argument requires God to have given a fictious history, either in the Bible or the the natural world.  Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term  light year.   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.  I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar.  On the contrary, I did just that. Under your argument, the conclusion is God is a liar.   So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace.   God does that not make God an epic liar?  lol. Good luck proving that. You don't even understand your original argument.
