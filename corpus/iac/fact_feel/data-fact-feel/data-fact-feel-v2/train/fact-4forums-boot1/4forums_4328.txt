No, the logical explanation was already worked out by scientists several decades ago.  RNA was theorized to be able to perform both informational and catalytic ability, thus serving the biological roles of both DNA (information storage) and proteins (biocatalysts). The theory was confirmed, I believe in the early 1980s, when ribozymes - catalytic RNAs - were disovered. And since then, scientists have been able to evolve in the lab a ribozyme that is capable of copying part of its own sequence. They are getting close to confirming the theory that an RNA molecule can serve as the information store and the catalytic machinery for its own replication.
