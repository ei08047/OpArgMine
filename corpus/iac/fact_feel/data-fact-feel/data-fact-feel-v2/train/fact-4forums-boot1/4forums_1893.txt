I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry (not always, but sometimes). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself.
