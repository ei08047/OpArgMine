No I didn't miss it, I was hoping you'd actually put forward an argument against what I said, not what you think I said. See what I actually said was the tautology. Then make your argument.  Note Post 30  He said evolution is a tautology.  I said that Darwin preferred a tautology to  Natural Selection   You may have mixed up who it is you're arguing against.
