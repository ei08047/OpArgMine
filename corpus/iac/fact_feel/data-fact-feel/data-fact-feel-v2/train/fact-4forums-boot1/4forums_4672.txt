Last month, the Justice Department reported that the FBI had kept thousands of names on its watch list based on outdated information and should have removed them.  In other words with out due process of any kind nor a resort to clear your name, people are on a list. A terrorist list often with out knowledge of how they got there. Or even if they are on there. Yet we the people are supposed to trust  big brother  to be honest. Now lautenberg and the rest of jackals are rushing to ensure you will lose any rights you may have had prior to being placed on this list.
