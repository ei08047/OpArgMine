Cahuella,  The Crusades (for the most part) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression. If you would like to see a recent discussion of this then go to the  Compromise  thread on this forum and see what Simone and I discussed.  As to the sperm and egg being a thing very similar to a fertilized egg..I think that may be a bit of a simplification.  As to the Church making fair decisions, I believe it does.

I was wondering where you had gone.
