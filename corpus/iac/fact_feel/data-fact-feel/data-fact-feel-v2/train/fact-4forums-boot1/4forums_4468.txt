And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.  Can you state that in English? What does that mean?  What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant? What are you smoking?  Certainly not. Why would you make such a remark? While a mutation that allowed a bacteria to metabolize nylon waste products is most certainly an example of evolution, heart transplants (artificial or otherwise) aren't. It is an ignorant assertion to claim that they are.  Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? Much less can science offer  proof  of evolution by means of organ transplants. The idea is simple minded at best.  since it seems to be important to you, why don't you offer  proof  that evolution doen't happen. Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread.
