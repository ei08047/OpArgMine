I think you have a point in some respects, but it is generally the profit incentive that really pushes and drives advances. Bell's telephone networks are still running and Edison's light bulb is lighting the way. The dishwasher to the automobile to the many patents of GE have all been private. Look at other countries (ie. the former USSR and China) who generally rely on stolen technology for their economies and military, since the real breakthroughs come from profit motivated systems.
