I have to agree with Jo Bennett here Fracas, you're simply injecting your personal opinion about morality into a conversation on statistics. One has nothing to do with the other.  Muddying the Waters is a tactic all too easily realized.  Oh, and about your previous responce to my question. I would behouve you to pay attention to whom is doing the posting to understand their intent and bias.
