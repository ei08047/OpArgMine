 Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 (P<.05) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P<.05).  Conclusions. On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur  each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.   http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon...dennis_culhane  Not owning a gun makes me safer and two cherry picked 911 calls does not disprove that.
