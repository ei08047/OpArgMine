I'm not sure what you're saying.  The fundamental issue isn't how marriage should be defined, but whether or not the government ought to single out a particular special interest group -- straights -- for special treatment, notwithstanding promises to all citizens that all deserve equal protection under the United States Constitution.  The way to rectify the incongruity is to take away the special preference. Do away with all the tax breaks and special legal advantages that accrue only to straights or let those advantages accrue to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.
