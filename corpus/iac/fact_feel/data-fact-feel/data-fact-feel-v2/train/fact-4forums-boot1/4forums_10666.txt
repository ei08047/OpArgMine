No, it is not contradictive. There are many different theories on this topic, though.  The bible states that a) we have free will -- aka choices, and b) God has whatever plan for everyone...  In Genesis, Adam and Eve made the choice to eat from the tree, but He used the bad to do something (supposedly) good.
