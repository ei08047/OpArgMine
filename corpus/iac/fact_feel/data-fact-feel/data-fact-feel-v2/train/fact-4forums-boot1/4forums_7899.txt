Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?

One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.  Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?
