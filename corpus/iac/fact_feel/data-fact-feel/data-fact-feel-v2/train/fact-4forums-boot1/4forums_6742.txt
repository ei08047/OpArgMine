This is not a part of the argument, though. Whether or not the woman can or cannot perform activities she wishes to do (which is not the case in pregnancy, btw, or at least varies greatly according to the individual) is irrelevant; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you. The argument is equally applicable no matter the womanÂ’s mobility.
