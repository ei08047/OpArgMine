Any proof that the man was the legal owner of the gun and not a hoodlum or mugger or sociopath that was bent on murder?  I can come up with a lot of examples of police proving that they should never be armed, or even given a badge to wear. They've been caught trafficking guns to known criminals, tasering innocent bystanders, abusing their powers, and just plain breaking the laws for their own amusement.
