Simply put, the only way gun control could work is if all guns were destroyed and none ever made again.  Murder, robbery, and rape would still happen- people would just use other weapons.  Not only that, but guns level the playing field. A criminal is not going to pull out a gun and mug someone if he knows the other guy is armed.  A good example is britian- after there gun ban went into effect general crime rates rose about 200%.
