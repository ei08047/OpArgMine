The court followed the idea of not changing the game after it has been played. They changed the law, but they wont undo what had been done before the law change. For example, say the changed the fine for speeding to 10,000 dollars. People who had already been given speeding tickets would not be fined more money.  People who were married before prop 8 did so completely legally. The law has been changed, but the act of marrying that they performed was legal at the time it was performed, so it would be wrong to undo that.
