No, that example dealt with how goverment should deal with it.  Does the ocean abide to your right to life as you drown?  Does the avalanche abide to your right to liberty as you are trapped?  Does the pack of hyenas abide to your right to property as they rob you of food?  An inalienable right can only be removed by God. Therefore everything BUT God must respect and abide to it. How can a right that is clearly not abided to be inalienable?
