Just because 99% of astrophysicists believe that the earth orbits the sun, why should you? Just because 99% of medical doctors believe that germs cause disease, why should you? Just because 99% of geologists believe that plate subduction causes vulcanism, why should you? (I know I lost you on that one.) Just because 99% of physicists believe that the sun produces energy by nuclear fusion, why should you? And that's why I don't consult my plumber or my mechanic about plantar fasciitis. What do you know that makes you better informed than thousands upon thousands of scientists who have spent decades of study in their subject. But you, who hasn't read a single book or paper have done a  detailed study  (of course with an open mind) and concluded that you are right and they are wrong. Moreover, you think that the terminally ignorant should be allowed to vote on science.
