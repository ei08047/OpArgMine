Legislating against abortion is DEFINATELY NOT the way to go. If you think that will stop it (I'm not sure if you are but that's what it sounds like in this post) then you are delusional. Ever heard of the Prohibition (18th amendment)? I think that that case clearly shows the furility of legislating against something like this. Outlawing abortion will not reduce the amount of women who become pregnant and have abortions, it will just make having abortions more dangerous for them when they have to go to back-alley clinics and such to get the procedure done.
