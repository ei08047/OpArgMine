I'm not sure what you're thanking Kronus for (or simone in post #3). All either has done is confirm that no, you can't prove god's non-existence. I infer from your gratitude that you feel that an inability to prove its non-existence makes some kind of point in favour of its existence: if so, think again. An inability to prove the non-existence of leprechauns does not make their existence any more likely either.
