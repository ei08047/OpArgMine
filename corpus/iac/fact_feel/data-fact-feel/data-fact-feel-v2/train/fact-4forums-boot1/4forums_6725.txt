**  A bit more on the number of [supposedly] 'random', 'spontaneous' mutations involved in the evolution of the ability to metabolize nylon waste.   Some more background, in Flavobacterium there are four nylonase genes, nylA, nylB and nylB' (which are duplicates) and nylC, carried on one plasmid. In Pseudomonas there are two nylonase genes (nyl A and nyl B, homologous to the nylA and nylB genes in Flavobacterium) carried on two different plasmids.    from--http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/apr04.html  The link continues with rationalization of the eubacterial heuristic mechanism for molecular adaptation, i.e., its plasmid dna system, as if what that system does is stochastic rather than heuristic, i.e., random rather than systematic.  The fat-headed pomposity of the ideologue voicing his opinion [Ian Musgrave]is really quite comical.
