You can consider it all you want philosophically, you just can't figure it into science, not at present. It's not as though Creationists have any idea how to test Intelligent Design, because  Goddidit!  isn't a scientific theory. And no matter how much ID Creationists like to pretend they aren't all about god and biblical creation, they are transparent in their disingenuity.
