You mention that the US leads the world in gun violence. Free societies often pay a price as a result of free people making bad decisions.  I would rather live in a country like ours where some people carry guns. If people who lived in Rawanda a few years back had a few guns, I believe they would have prevented thousands of murders and mutilations (inflicted by machetes, btw).
