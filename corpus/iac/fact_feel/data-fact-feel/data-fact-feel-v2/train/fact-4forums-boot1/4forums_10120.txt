At the start of the Gulf War there were more American soldiers available. Since the latest war those numbers have dropped substantially.  If worse came to worse? Maybe IEDs, maybe even construction equipment like bulldozers or wrecking balls. We have all kinds of vehicles that the Iraqis don't have, might be interesting to see how a monster truck would hold up to hitting a tank. Might also be interesting to see what would happen if a tank was buried in concrete from a cement truck.
