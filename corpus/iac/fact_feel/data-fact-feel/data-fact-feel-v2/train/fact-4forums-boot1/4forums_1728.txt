Well you can get injured very badly playing baseball, you can get killed (just the other day some high school coach took a batting practice ball right in the head and died). And I have not heard a single person say that pregnancy is something no one should have to go through. I know I don't. And yes people sometimes do force a woman to get pregnant, it's called rape.
