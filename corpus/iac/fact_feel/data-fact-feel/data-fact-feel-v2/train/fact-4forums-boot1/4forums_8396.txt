And I'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case. Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court. In fact, only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature.  Who knew...but there is a wikipedia page on this: Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  It doesn't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action.  Also, the Supreme Court case ruled the Virginia law unconstitutional not the Alabama law. It is just understood that similar laws will be overturned thus they are negated.
