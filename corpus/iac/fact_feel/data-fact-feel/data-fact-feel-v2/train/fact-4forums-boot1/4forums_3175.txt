Usually, but most of this has been quoted out of context by creationists and answered so often that it is an old story. Besides, as I mentioned, Feduccia has just published a detailed study on the embryology of bird digits. It supports his view, of course. I don't have a problem with that and it is certainly an issue worth study. My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago.  Also, since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered. Things are moving fast right now. Jeff Polling also has some information about the Ruben et al. article.  But the  bird hip/lizard hip  bit is pure nonsense that demonstrates profound ignorance or intentional deceit. The correct information is so easy to find. That sort of conduct certainly casts a bad light on creationism.
