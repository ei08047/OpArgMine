Grammatical would be spelling their instead of there. What you did was confuse two very different things. Are the moon and Saturn the same thing? No. Likewise the Earth and the Universe are not. Just because you're wrong doesn't make us  rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals.   You're still wrong. The age of the Universe has never in the past 50 years been thought to have been 4 billion years ago.  Yes. Speed of light calculated with distance from the origin of the oldest light, which equates to about 14 billion or so years.  Neanderthal were never a decedent of homo sapien. How many times have you been proven wrong on this thread alone?  I'd love to see this argument. As I recall, as others have said, Neanderthal and homo sapiens were contemporary species occupying some of the same geographical areas. Therefore they could not have been decedents of homo sapien as the two arouse roughly at the same time.  So I am correct about my asserations as to your education?  Still you completely fail to argue the merits of creationism without attacking evolution which would conclude as we have all thought previously that creationism cannot be defended or supported on its own merits
