You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state  antique  firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)  So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally.
