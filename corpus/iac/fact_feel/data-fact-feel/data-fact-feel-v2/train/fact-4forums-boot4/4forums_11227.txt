You actually can vote on this (of have your legislatures do it). Some issues require more than just a majority but you can still vote. If 80% of the people think all Jewish persons should live in Florida then its not looking for those Jewish persons that don't wish to live in Florida. This doesn't mean its the right thing to do but this is a flaw of democracy.
