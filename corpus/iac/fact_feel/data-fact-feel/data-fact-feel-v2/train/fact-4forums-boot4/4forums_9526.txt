Well firstly we do not know that  volition  must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.
