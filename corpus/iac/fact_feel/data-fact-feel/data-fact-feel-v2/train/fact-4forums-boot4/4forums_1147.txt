Walking-fish:  This appears to be a rare birth defect known as anencephaly, where the neural tube closes off prematurely in the fetus. Such infants lack a cerebrum, although they may have a brainstem. This is why they have such frog-like features. They usually die within a few hours or days, being virtual vegetables. Here is a link to the wikipedia description of anencephaly:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anencephaly
