Is this debate, either audio, video, or transcription, available on line, or will it be? I have bee a bit occupied in preparing for a tropical storm (possible hurricane) that turned out to be a fizzle (3.2 inches of rain over 10 hours and maybe 30 mph winds at worst). I'm dying to know if Comfort brought up the banana. It has always been my understanding that bananas (as well as cucumbers) were perfectly suited to other purposes. At least, I was told that it was the case by certain less than reverent female acquaintances when I was in college.
