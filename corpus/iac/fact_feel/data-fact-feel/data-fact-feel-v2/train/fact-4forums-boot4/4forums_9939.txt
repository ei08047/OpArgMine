Huh? Please expound how the Gates, the Gettys, the Kennedys, the Hiltons, the Rockafellers dominate the poor with guns. The rich can afford and can legally own them right now. Are they enslaving the poor right now at the end of a gun barrel?  Please explain that if a common man can store, use, and own modern military weapons as safe or even safer that the state; that he/she should not be allowed to own military weapons.
