Here is the reply to Moore's comments on his website:  http://www.hardylaw.net/replytomoore.html  Regardless of whether a lawsuit was filed or not...if the events portrayed in the film are wrong then they are wrong.. period.  Carefull editing of speechs made by Charleton Heston (on different dates) to get Moore's point across seem like  fabrication  to me....in essence....lies.  Therefore the whole movie is a lie.
