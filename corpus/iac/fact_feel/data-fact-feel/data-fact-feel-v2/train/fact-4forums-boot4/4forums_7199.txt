UK Civil Partnerships are not identical to marriage. There are a few small differences (and a heck of a lot more pages for the law books) because CPs are an entirely new entity. Most of the differences are minor, though I, and quite a few gay people in the UK, find one particularly insulting. CPs CANNOT have any religious component. Unlike heterosexual marriages which can be  completed  in a church by having someone  proclaim  them, CPs take effect upon the second signature, have no  proclamation  requirement, and cannot be  performed  in a church (though I guess nothing stops people from signing a document in a church).  It's a sop to the religious right and has quite a few religious folks angry that the government is seeking to dictate what can and cannot happen in a church.  more details:  http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/lgbt/faq.htm  http://www.pinkweddings.biz/thelaw.htm#b  http://www.equalitycoalition.org/pressrelease.asp?ID=4  Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.
