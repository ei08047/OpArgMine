Yes it does, by the definition of existence. We can't determine whether something exists or not if we do not define  existence.  I define it like this:  If something exists, then it can be detected.  If something cannot be detected, then it doesn't exist.  Note that the converses are not necessarily true.  Theists define  God  as something that cannot be detected. Therefore, their god does not exist. Pantheists define  God  as the universe. Polytheists define their gods as superhumans who live on top of mountains. This proof cannot disprove pantheism or polytheism, but it disproves theism.
