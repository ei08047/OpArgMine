I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal. What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be. However, I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away. Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago.
