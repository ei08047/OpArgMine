This has everything to do with guns,how are these people suppose to protect  themselves?Since the police have been told to just let them go, crime will run  rampant, it will become THE place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary,gosh wonder if they gotta let rapo's and killers runaway to.  Only 2000? I lived in George Wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not  necessarily from people who lived there.
