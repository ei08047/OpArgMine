I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.  Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.  You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.
