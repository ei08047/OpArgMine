You're kidding right? One could equally argue that if one has a soul then one is  immortal  and murder does not matter.  We have no reason to believe that a soul exists, but we have plenty of reasons to believe that people are self aware, which why murdering them is wrong, not the possible existence of some extra-physical super-natural essence thingy.
