I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the pro-life argument relies exclusively on religious doctrine. I'm a Conservative and religious, but I think that abortion can be discussed without bringing religion into it. My personal opinion is it's a mistake for Pro-lifers to bring religion into it because it fuels the hatred of the God-less Left LMAO
