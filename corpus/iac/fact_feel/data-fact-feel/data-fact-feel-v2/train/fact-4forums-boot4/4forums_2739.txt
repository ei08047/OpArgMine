Here is a good reason to ban magazines that can hold a lot of bullets.   A gunman walked into a military hospital clinic at Fairchild Air Force Base where he killed four people and wounded 21 others using a Chinese-made MAK-90 semi-automatic assault rifle....Spokane County Sheriff Larry Erickson called the semi-automatic assault rifle a 'mankiller' and claimed it is likely far fewer people would have been hurt had another weapon been used. 'This [gun] gave him the capability to fire as fast as he could pull the trigger. And that's a lot of rounds when you've got a 50-round magazine.'    http://feinstein.senate.gov/assault-weapons-support.htm
