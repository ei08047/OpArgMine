The scientific method must stick to the measurable, observable and testable otherwise it stops being, well, science.  The moment you invoke the supernatural as a reason for a natural event is when the science has stopped- for example intelligent design will go some way with the empirical and then flip to the supernatural at the last hurdle. ID would say this is the eye, its structure has evolved through organism x->y->z we see in the fossil record and then say God directly shaped this design as it is too complex to have happened by chance, whereas science will say the eye was a response to a natural evolutionary pressure say from predation, environment and so on and is a product of natural selection.  The latter view here could be reconcilled in a number of ways with a religious beief, but the former can never be reconcilled with science.
