The man made an aggressive move jumping out of the car. Notice the officer puts his hand on his service weapon as the man exits the car? Not a smart idea if you're carrying a gun, even with a CCW. The officer then sees or feels the gun and takes him down. There's a cut in the film just before the take down. What happens in the missing frames? We don't know.  You believe this encounter to be typical for folks packin' in public?  I'm not defending the officers necessarily but walk a mile in their shoes first.
