Then I'd like to see your definition of the scientific method. As I recall, the scientific method is purely secular.  What evidence of God? Please, show me such evidence. There is no evidence of God. God is of the supernatural, you cannot prove the supernatural with evidence from the natural! God cannot be proven, nor can it be disproven. There is no evidence of God, and there is no evidence that there is no unorthodox God.
