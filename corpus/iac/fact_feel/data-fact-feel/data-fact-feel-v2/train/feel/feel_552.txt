So, are you saying your friends don't deserve to live because they have no morals? I hope you don't blame the parents for the kids lack of judgement. They really have no excuse. There are, I am sure, many good families that have raised criminals. One of the things that mark maturity is not blaming your parents for your downfalls.
So are you saying that a person that is unloved in their youth would have been better off not having a shot at life? 
If you are please consider:
My Mom and Dad had the abortion appointment set up. That's how unwanted I was. Do you think I don't have a right to life? That I was better served not being able to give life a go?
My sister was divorced (for lack of a better word) from her parents, are you saying because they treated her poor she was better off not being?
A lousy beginning in life does not mean that a person's whole life will be worthless or unhappy.
have a nice day,
