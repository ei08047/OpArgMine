So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.
But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(
