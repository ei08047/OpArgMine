That's really simplified. It's not like a woman's body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self-reliant. It lives off her life processes - her blood, her immune system, her calories - it puts stress on her joints, muscles, heart, and bladder. Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental. No a baby isn't the woman's body - but a pregnancy IS.
