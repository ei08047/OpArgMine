I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.
Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).
