A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.
A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.
A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.
God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.
We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!
God is great.
God is good.
Let us thank Him for our food.
God is my shepherd.
God is my Light.
God is my Co-pilot.
God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.
When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)
