But why is that criteria of birth important, in your view, for calling it a person? Is the existence of a person dependent on their physical location, in your view (in this case, inside the woman's body vs outside)? Otherwise, are there other characteristics that change in the fetus from the moments it is inside the body to the moment it is outside of the body? How about when it is born but not yet disconnected from its mother by cutting the umbilical cord?
I understand that you might be stating this for legal reasons - i.e. defining person as born since the term person might automatically have rights attached and you don't want any rights for fetuses - no matter what their state of development. If so, then I would say that you are putting the cart before the horse. In viewing moral issues, I think one should try to understand the fundamentals and then work legal opinions around those fundamentals - not the other way around.
