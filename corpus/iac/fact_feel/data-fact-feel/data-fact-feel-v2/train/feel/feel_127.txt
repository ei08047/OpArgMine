Well here is a christian who supports abortion.
I personally HAVE had an abortion. I had it several years, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision, I chose what was best for me. I was engaged (now married), and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control (I was on the pill and he used condoms). Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.
I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable, especially because I think that except for rare circumstances, abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester (the exceptions would be if the woman's life was in danger, etc. for a later abortion).
As to God not supporting abortion? Rubbish. If you'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions, but ordered forced abortions through his people (that is if you take the OT as literally true)
