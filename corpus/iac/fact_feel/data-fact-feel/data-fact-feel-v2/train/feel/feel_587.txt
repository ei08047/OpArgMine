The deceived one is you Brady. How many of those alleged lives taken by gun violence were police shootings? How many by gang memebrs killing other gang members? Where did you come up with your figures Brady, VPC your namesake group? They are thoroughly discredited as you should realize by now. How many are suicides? The prevention models for these are different in case you were unaware. 
You fail to even consider how many of those lives were taken by criminals in the commission of a crime. Yet you would render us helpless to them in your quest for a non hostile working environment. Show exactly where in the constitution and Bill of Rights the wording for gun control. Here is a clue, they aren't there. 
If you were truely concerned about loss of innocent life then you would be supporting laws to keep the violent criminal away from society. Instead they are free after many arrests and convictions to prey upon a society that you would render helpless. Why Brady?
