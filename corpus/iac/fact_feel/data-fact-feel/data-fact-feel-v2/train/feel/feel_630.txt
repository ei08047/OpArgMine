Not at all. Your answers were without content or meaning. There was no sarcasm. You snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them. You have no answers and have been reduced to insult. That means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost. Otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers. You have made yourself a fool with nothing but names and insults.
