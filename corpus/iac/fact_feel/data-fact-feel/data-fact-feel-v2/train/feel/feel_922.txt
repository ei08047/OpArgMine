Your concept of there being no God is an irrational claim, that leads, inevitably, to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise. I copied your words as it may be easiest to for you to understand the point I am trying to make. The use of God is a rational assumption. Your use of there not being a God is an assumption. By definition of reason, it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image, our "intellectual faculty" would also be made in His image. Thus it is rational and logical. Hence, the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical. While evolution says we are accidents, and hence, our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets (i.e we would be irrational and illogical). After reasoning, the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical.
As you can see from the definition of reason, it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to. Another word for this faith is assumptions.
