Well, the funny thing is... if he's so public about his plans and even if he succeeds a little, the SEC will probably come in and bankrupt he and his flock and ruin the rest of their lives. He probably would end up facing a fair amount of jail time. Stock manipulation is illegal. And a giant like Microsoft will be out for blood. His being so vocal about it is probably the dumbest thing he could do. This guy is not playing with a very bright bulb.
And, yes, you'd think that he'd be pouring all his energy into feeding the poor, helping New Orleans recover from Hurricane George. Some of these christian folk have their priorities so twisted it makes me sick.
