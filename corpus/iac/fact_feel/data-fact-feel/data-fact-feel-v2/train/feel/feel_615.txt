So now anytime you don't like something, you're going to whine and bemoan it until there's a law passed that makes it illegal, so it can't possibly ever happen again?
Where does a mentality like that stop? Are you going to push for it to be illegal for a parent to let their child go out and play without first applying sunscreen so they don't get burned?
