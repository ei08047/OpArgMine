well, it is irrational if you believe that human life is a good thing. Some people tend to think that it is ok to degrade people because it 1) makes economic sense 2) cuts down on the population 3) makes THEIR life easier. However, when you degrade people you make society worse off...so I really don't see a point. :) Nice to see you here by the way.
