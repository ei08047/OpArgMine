I think that environmental and political concerns should certainly take part in these decisions, though I will not go so far as to assign their importance. Yes, there should be freedom of choice, but should your choices infringe on another's? If we're talking in thirty feetses, sure as heck, i want you to stay out of mine! 
But there are always other circumstances. Should a wealthy landowner deeded with several acres be entitled to have as many kids as his land will support? maybe. Should a wealthy woman with tons of money be able to have as many kids as her pocket will allow? maybe
But on the other hand, should a poor woman without two red cents to rub together be required to abort her very loved and wanted child? probably not.
