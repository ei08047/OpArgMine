Partly because it is entirely dependent on one particular human being for its survival, after birth the baby can be looked after by pretty much anyone, before it is entirely reliant on one person, if that person dies, the feotus dies. I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human, it has the potential to become human. The closer any being is to being human the more value I tend to place on its life. I value monkeys more than I value cows, for example, I value cows more than I value mice, or rats. I would only kill cows for food, not for sport or because they were irritating. Mice I would kill or have killed if there was an infestation and I couldn't get rid of them any other way, insects I'm not too bothered about swatting if they annoy me. The feotus I consider to be close to human, closer than any other species and, whilst I consider it wrong to kill it, I can understand why others don't and recognise that banning abortion also results in suffering and loss of life. It's a difficult decision for me whether the loss of feotuses is balanced by the suffering prevented, lives saved and freedom promoted by keeping it legal.
