Foolish Clergymen.
How can this work? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart. 
You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs. It simply must be all or nothing. Otherwise you are wasting your time.
