But stress a child, it would be wrong to judge a child by the circumstances of its birth but as a developing embryo I do not think it can be treated the same way. Adoption may be preferable if possible but if someone is causing harm, albeit even unintentionally they are still responsible. The whole idea of manslaughter is based around this, without even going on to criminals being a product of their environment - they may have had apparently little choice in their crimes. This does not exempt them from punishment though - they serve to prevent future crimes or to stop the contining harm being caused.
