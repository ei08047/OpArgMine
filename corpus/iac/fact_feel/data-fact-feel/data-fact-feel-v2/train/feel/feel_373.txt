no, that's not what I mean. It's not like it's fine to kill anything. I'm not going to walk up to someone in a coma and kill them just because they can't control their actions and think as good as everyone else. It's just better than walking up to a person walking down the road and stabbing them in the back. It's just if you got pregnant 'cause of rape or something, don't you think it would be better toget an abortion when the baby can't really think, etc. I know it's still bad, but it's better. That's all I think she's trying to say, and if not, that's what I say. I mean, if a 12 year old got pregnant 'cause someone raped her, don't you think she should get an abortion, and the earliest the better?
