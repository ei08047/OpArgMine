I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.
