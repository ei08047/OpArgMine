You said in the other post "A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live. We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun.
And no, people does not discipline themselves. You might claim I have to much trust in the government, I would claim you have to much trust in your fellow man. When you give freedom to the people you give freedom to criminals too. I don´t trust guns to only be used in 'selfdefense'.
I want my government to uphold justice and to protect me from criminals. That´s one of their purposes. And that is impossible without a certain amount of control over the citizens."
This is liberal.. you believe governments are smarter than people. You do not trust your fellow man you trust governments made up of men. You are willing to restrict my freedoms based on activities of criminals.
You sir are a liberal.
