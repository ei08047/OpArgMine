NOW YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK HERE DUDE.
I'm sure there are some people that deal all kinds of things, but someone who regularly sells pot pretty much only sells pot. I'm not saying 100%of the time, but pot smokers don't go into some ghetto crackhouse to get their pot.
Jesus, man, are you that out of touch?
