Crackpot suggests that the environment changes to suit organisms! More at 11.
Unsurprisingly, SS has abandoned another thread and -- unbelievably -- started another showing even more ignorance of basic biology. I didn't think it could be done. How silly of me.
Well, I could just post the above, but SS would no doubt jump up and down having a hissy fit about how I "wasn't able" to counter his points. So here's a short list:


* Selection does not require inability to breed, only differential breeding rates.
* Ring species demonstrate precisely what SS asserts doesn't exist.
* Selection is not survival of the fittest. Although much better descriptions exist, it could better be described as "statistically preferential perpetuation of the fittest."
* Many primates fight within their own tribes to gain dominance. Infanticide is common. Do you consider this "for the benefit of the population"?
* Even were there universal cooperation among populations, that wouldn't prevent differences in fitness.
* SS provides no quote or citation for the alleged assertion that [a certain occurrance of] evolution could never happen the same way twice.
I would also like to point out that once again we have a broken link that shows that not only is supersport simply copying and pasting his baloney, his common sense is so lacking that after being called on this numerous times, he doesn't even pay attention to the problem.
Run, SS, run!
