I was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion. Liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life. They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we're too dumb to fend for ourselves. They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they don't trust parents to be parents. The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless. 
And I have no problem with gays, just their attempts to redefine marriage.
