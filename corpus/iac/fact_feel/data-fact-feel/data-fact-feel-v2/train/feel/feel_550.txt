I know you said "God" however, you are wrong (not unusual) when you say Muslims believe in the same God as the Jews and Christians. More examples of your ignorance. 
By the way, everyone in the world believes in a God. For some people, it's the 'Great Spirit', others 'Allah', then the true God, the one of the Bible, and lastly, some people don't believe in a superior being, but they believe themselves to be god.
