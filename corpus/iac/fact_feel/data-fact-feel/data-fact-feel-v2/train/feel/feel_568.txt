Holy Moles! Chloe! This is absolutely the worst analogy you could possibly use.
Jeepers creepers! Do you have absolutely any sense at all of history?
It was the RULE for RICH CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN EUROPE NOT TO BREASTFEED THEIR BABIES BECAUSE IT WOULD THEM SEXUALLY UNATTRACTIVE TO THEIR RICH CHRISTIAN HUSBANDS!!! A poor woman was usually hired to serve as a wetnurse for said child--and I certainly hope that the children of that poor woman did not suffer as a result of the poor woman's economic need to serve as a wetnurse for a RICH CHRISTIAN WOMAN'S CHILD, but you can be very sure that THE RICH CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND HER RICH, DEMANDING CHRISTIAN HUSBAND DID NOT GIVE A FLYING FARK ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THE poor woman's children!
