I have to agree with you. The Mother is usually the one responsible for conceiving the baby. The man should be responsible too, but she's the one who will get pregnant and she has to consent to sex. I don't think a woman should have the right to do what she likes with her body and kill her baby whenever she gets pregnant. I think the responsibility rests with the Mother first in this case, and the baby should not die for her.
