Hi jitobear. I am also pro-choice. This comment jumped out at me, though. Do you think it's seen as awful do to cultural conditioning? Could this have it wrong? There is no scientific basis that it's a human person, at the stage of development when the vast majority of abortions occur. I worry that by suggesting it's so negative, it can't help but be a stigma on the woman who chooses to abort her pregnancy. No woman should feel the need to apologize in relation to abortion, which is just about control over one's own body.
