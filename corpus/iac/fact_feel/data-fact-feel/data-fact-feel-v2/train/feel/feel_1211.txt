Prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes. They better get ready to pay, in taxes, for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children. 
I would gladly double my taxes to help save the weak and the unborn.
Better idea though instead of locking up the women/men seeking termination and euthanasia why not lock up the obs/gyno/ and doctors that carry out theses procedures?
Pro life is NOT just about termination of pregnancies.
