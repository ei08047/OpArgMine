I'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist (except for going to a religious school.
I didn't really think it was fair and balanced at all. It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path. The reasons it gave for being atheist were they hadn't found god yet, and a tradgedy. What about logically thinking about it? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase? They also say atheism is the easy way out. I think it's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted. I'm not saying people do but I'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism. All you have to do is believe in god and you're safe for your life and afterwards. Most Atheists don't believe what they do just to rebel or haven't found God yet. Mostly it's because they realized that there is no logical proof (enough for them) that there is God. They also said incorrectly that atheism isn't a religion.

Wouldn't you say the belief that there is no god and when we die we die qualifies as this?
