I've said more truth on this forum alone than you could ever hope to comprehend. Of course, overwhelming your comprehension probably isn't hard at all, so perhaps that's not saying much. To say that Archie has a better track record with the truth here than do I is pretty much admitting that you haven't been following along, can't read, or are delusional as Archie is. I won't rule out a combination.
