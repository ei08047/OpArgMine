It's not that we pro life people don't care about womens rights it's that we care about the babies rights too. They won't do abortion after the 3rd month right? Well the baby is living, it has a heartbeat, it has nerves, eyes, and all that. I think it is sickening when people say that the baby or fetus whatever you want to call it doesn't feel anything. Everyone always says "what if they get raped? Would you have the baby?" Well for one only 1% of abortions are done because of rape. Secondly if you are raped you can go to the hospital and tell them what happened and they will do an emergency IUD. Why does the women get to choose who can come into the world? They are going to kill it and they don't care. You never knew what the baby could have been. They could have been the one to find the cure to cancer, aids, or another uncurable disease. Your not giving the baby a chance and that is wrong and not fair. Thats my opinion.
