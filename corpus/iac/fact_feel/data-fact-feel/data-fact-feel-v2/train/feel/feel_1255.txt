One has to wonder why gun haters always ask this quesion. 
Has this question ever been asked of people that read books? It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like. The gun haters clearly like the 1st amend. 
The gun haters use their 1st amend right to attack the right to bear arms. When racist use their 1st amend right to attack other peoples right it is called hate speech. So why is it that gun haters demanding the banning of the right to bear arms is not considered hate speech? After all gun haters are just like the other hate groups. All they do is attack the right to bear arms. Not once has a gun hater ever demand that dangerous criminals be punished.
