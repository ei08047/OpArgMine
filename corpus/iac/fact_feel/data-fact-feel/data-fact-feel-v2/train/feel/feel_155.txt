But what would be the minimum for you to survive? Here I am getting at the essence of self. For example, if you went into a coma with severe brain damage such that your body was alive but you had no mental processes left - no thoughts, emotions, sense of pain, no mental processes whatsoever apart from brain function controlling your body (heart rate, etc.) - would "you" have survived? Or would "you" essentially be gone at that point?
