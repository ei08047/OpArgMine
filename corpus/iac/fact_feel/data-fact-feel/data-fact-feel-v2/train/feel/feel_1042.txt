gotta start at square 1. 
it seems the best definition anybody came up with for God is "the greatest possible being". this means a being that can do and know anything and everything that is POSSIBLE to do and know.
this obviously means that God cannot do the impossible
if everybody can agree on this, then we could really work on acknowledging what God can do, and even if he can exist
i would like to start by asserting that the "greatest possible being" DOES exist. this has been proven
