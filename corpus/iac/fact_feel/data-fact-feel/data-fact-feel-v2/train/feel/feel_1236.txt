That reminds me of the discussion I got into on a "christian" board when I referred to a particular pompous XXX as a pompous XXX. I was banned for a week for using profane language. Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless. My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem. Didn't phase them. They also ignored without comment references to Judge Roy Moore's monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court building. Yanking fundy chains can be so much fun sometimes.
