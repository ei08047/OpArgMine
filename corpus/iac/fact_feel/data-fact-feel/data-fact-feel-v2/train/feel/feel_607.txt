Well, 'convenience' is a debatable word here - its convenient for you to let a great number of people in Africa die because you want a TV, or electricity or a holiday, whilst its far less convenient for someone to have to carry a child. They will actually phsyically suffer whilst you just don't get the latest in modern western luxuries. Abortion as a means of birth control is just not a good idea though.
