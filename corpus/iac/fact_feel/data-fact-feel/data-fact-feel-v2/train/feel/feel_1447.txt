NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.
As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.
I would also add one more lisencing rule
8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.
