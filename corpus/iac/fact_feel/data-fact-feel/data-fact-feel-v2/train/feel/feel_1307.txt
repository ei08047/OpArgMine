This is the line that caused me to butt in, walking-fish. Again, my apologies, but prs has no idea of the difference between Lamarckian and Darwinian theory, and how that theoretical difference would be reflected in different social theories. As far as I can tell prs has nothing but preconceived misconceptions about this. I felt compelled to speak up. Hope you're not put out about my intrusion.
