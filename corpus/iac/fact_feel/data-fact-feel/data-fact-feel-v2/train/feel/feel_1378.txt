Do you have a quote? a link? anything to make us think that you're not spinning this like you tend to spin everything else?
Here's something you didn't think through: you say that "inherent" human dignity is a derivative of the image-of-God claim. First, that makes it most certainly not inherent but derived. Second, you insult the entire human race when you claim that human dignity is dependent upon anything else. I'm sorry that you think so little of humans.
