You deserve to get insulted for the follwoing reasons:
You post the same garbage at several forums 
You start thread after thread with the regurgiposted garbage at forum after forum
You refuse to even try to understand the answers you are given, and when given answers, just ask more questions until the answerer grows tired of playing games
You abandon threads only to start new ones on the same topics later
Lather, rinse, repeat
You do not want discussion. You do not want answers. YOu do not want to try to understand the things you read - look at your caterpiller color debacle.
Your 'mission' is to overwhgelm with volume because you know you lose on details.
Trying to discuss things with you is like a hamster on a treadmill - it goes round and round and you end up right where you began. For crying outy loud, at CARM you have started yet another thread linking to the same Bruce Lipton website you did a couple of months ago, making the same basic claims as you did then.
