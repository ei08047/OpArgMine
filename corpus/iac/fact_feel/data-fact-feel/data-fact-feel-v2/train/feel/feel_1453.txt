Hahahaha, there could be 100 crazed flat-earth creationists joining with me in asking questions about evolution and astronomy, and it wouldn’t be within light years of the panic and scrambling that evolutionists/atheists have been doing for years now concerning ID. This thread is just aimed at watching the dances. Would I be getting the insults I’m getting in this thread if they all didn’t find this troubling? At least I’m not advocating hauling astronomy to court and getting it thrown out of significant parts of the public realm. Do you think they’re all genuinely mystified that someone would suggest that other branches of science be held to the same criteria that evolutionists have set for ID? This thread wouldn't exist without it, a lot of controversy wouldn't exist without it, the thoughtfulness and usefulness of science has been thrown into confusion just because militant atheists found a branch of it they didn't personally like, and emotionally set criteria for it that they don't want applied to other branches of it that they do like. Science has been taken over by atheists, and now it's political. It's going to stay that way. Atheists shouldn't complain about it - they caused it.
