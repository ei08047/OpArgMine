But most creationists are YECs. The word has taken on bad connotations so it sounds a bit sour to call a theistic evolutionist a "creationist." The most usual use of the word is as the name of someone who believes that the Bible is literal, including creation in 6 days, Adam and Eve in a magic garden, and a global flood. Someone who relieves in God but recognizes that much of the Bible is composed of moral tales and the mythology of the ancient Hebrews isn't really a "creationist." I guess we could run down the list of degrees of creationism from flat earth to theistic evolution if you want.
