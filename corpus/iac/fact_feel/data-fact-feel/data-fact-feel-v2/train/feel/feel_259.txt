Ouch! And we're one of your best allies!
You know that really hurts. Maybe that "We're American, screw the world" attitude is why you're getting planes hurled at you. And we're one of your best allies and you don't care about us?
But, yes, one is too many. A nut case who is so freaked out that he thinks his own government is out to steal everything he has, is one too many.
The good thing though, is you've now painted yourself into a corner.
You say no one cares about me because I'm from Australia.
So, if you reply to this, it means you do care. And if you don't then as far as we're concerned, I've had the last word. Thank you. emoticonXGood
