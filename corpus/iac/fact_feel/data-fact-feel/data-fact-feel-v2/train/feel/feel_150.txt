Hardly. Obviously I had a lot more sense than you. My house and land is paid for long ago, I refused all credit cards including VISA and BOA and shun debt. Hardly a hack until is comes to strong arm union tactics who use force to chill public debate or frighten working folks in their family home...unless they are public officials. emoticonXCensored I have worked mobs in an official capacity I don't think you can enlighten me much on mobocracy. I think your whole problem is you bought the scenario of blame the messenger to avoid placing the economic blame where it belongs. What is next? 60's style Alinsky tactics and bombing those you disagree with on American soil?
