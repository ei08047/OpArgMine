It depends. Do you feel the same way about the Yeti? How about the Lock Ness monster? 
You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence, I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods.' 
I think it is intellectual fence sitting myself. I feel the same way about God as i do about fairies, the yeti, alien abductions, and 'psychic powers'. There is no evidence that any of these exist, so based on the evidence, I don't believe they exist. Should new evidence be forthcoming, I will reevalutate my position based on that evidence.
