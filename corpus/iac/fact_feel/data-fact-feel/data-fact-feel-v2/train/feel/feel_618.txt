Oh irrational-boy, please do try to understand basic concepts.
It's simple, I've been through this before.
If you know something of the unknowable, then you contradict yourself. It's a self-contradictory statement. One you're fond of, I realize, but illogical just the same.
You can test this by trying to show me something that is unknowable. 
See the dillema you face? Yes, self-contradiction. You may be so use to this feeling that you've grown numb to it, but in black and white, you are making a self-contradictory statement.
This is the same reason you have to have faith. Rational demonstration is useless when trying to show something without evidence or without rational demonstration, which is the case with your "unknowable, self-contradictory" idea of a god.
This is why you MUST believe through faith, which requires no rational demontration. It's no secret why faith needs no evidence, it CANNOT use evidence, it's the opposite of reason. Why do you think the term faith exists in the first place? Reason does fine with the rational world. You needed a word to fit the irrational. Otherwise, why would you need faith?
It's the same reason you can have 1000 different gods and beliefs of gods out there and not a single one is somehow "more credible" than any other. They are all based without reason, without evidence, irrationally.
All ties together rather neatly doesn't it?
Science >> Religion
Reason >> Faith
Rational >> Irrational
Evidence >> No evidence
Reason: Capable of seperating truth from false (to degree, based on evidence), and thus produces knowledge (That which we find to be true).
Faith: Incapable of producing ANY KNOWLEDGE

Stick to your side of the fence please, unless you adopt reason as your means.
