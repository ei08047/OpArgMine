And yes, I have seen the signs for help centers, and I think that is a good thing... there should be organizations like that, to show women that there ARE other choices for them so that they don't think that their only option is abortion. But I still feel that they should have the right to decide what they want to do... but not just women.. if the father in question is involved, I think they should be a part of that decision too...
