Oh, it's politics! [Slapping forehead with hand] What was I thinking?? If I find any KKK members are against relaxing drug laws, I guess I'd better change my view and start opposing drug laws. And if I happen to find that there are KKK members who don't mind U.S. involvement in the UN, I'll be sure and oppose any U.S. involvement in the U.N. I wonder if any of them have parents on medicare? Doh!! Guess I better oppose any form of socialized healthcare! emoticonXRolleyes
