You don't see how gun-control interferes with self-preservatlion?
Hmmmm? OK, simple. I want to defend myself with a handgun. I really can't if I don't have one do I.
Sure you can defend yourself in a gun free society such as Canada. I want to defend myself with a gun when the felons only have knives. I really can't do that if I don't have a gun do I. Your responsible for your own protection, not me.
