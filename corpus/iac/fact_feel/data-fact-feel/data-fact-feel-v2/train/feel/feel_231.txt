Well you just made the ultimate mistake. Trying to justify things based on your belief in God skews your views and doesn't allow you to make a logical decision anyways. This has basically just become a religious debate instead of one on abortion and I think if you want to find the answer to this question you will need to debate on the Religion board.
Also if everything that occurs is Gods will, then isn't it Gods will that an abortion take place if it does occur?
I won't debate that an aborted baby could have been responsible for an important event in the future if it had been born, but this is a rare event. I submit to you this idea as well if you like the cases of rare events. What if one of those babies grew up and killed someone who would be responsible for an important future event had he lived long enough to do so? That is a rare case as well. I'm sure you will say this doesn't justify abortion and I'll agree with you because both our points about low probability instances are so rare that they shouldn't matter in this debate anyways.
