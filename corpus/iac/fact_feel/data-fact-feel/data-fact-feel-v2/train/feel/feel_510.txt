That analogy doesn't work here.
It appears that your beef is with the prestige associated with being able to say "We're married." as opposed to recognizing yourselves as "same-sex couples with all the rights and privileges afforded married couples".
The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation. A gay man can marry any woman that will have him. A lesbian can marry any man that will have her. You are not denied the right to marry...so long as you comply with the rules of marriage...including the one about one male and one female.
Changing definitions just to satisfy the ego of any one group is patently ridiculous. One might ask why we can't call ourselves female when we are actually male or why males shouldn't be allowed to enroll in an all girls school.
If it benefits you want, have at it. Work on Congress to come up with something like PACS.
If it's an attack on the definition of marriage, then get lost.
