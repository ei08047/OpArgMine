Before writing your biography, Mariast,.... did you happen to note the title and subject of the thread?
"What would it take to change your mind about abortion?"
I have a beautiful daughter myself. 
Her life began at conception. 
How do I know this?
I was there.
Her conception was the very first time that a part of me (and a part of her mother) became a part of Her.
