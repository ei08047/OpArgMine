What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -
until, as you said: Hopefully, the person "finds some way of forgiving themselves", right. 
But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research & quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.
Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.
