So then the anti abortionists POV should, in your opinion, overrides the POV of the woman that the issue concerns? Why is it that to you the religious belief of the anti abortionist is more important then the body of the woman? The fetus is a parasite on the woman, just as a tape worm is. Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises, then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms.
Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same. Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?
