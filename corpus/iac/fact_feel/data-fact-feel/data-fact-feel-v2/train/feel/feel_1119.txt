So if I did find a vender, then what would you say? Why do we prevent the importation of weapons grade plutonium? Shouldn't that be protected under the second amendment? Why doesn't the government allow people to produce nucleur weapons? If the government suddenly stopped all production of guns except those that were sold to the Department of defense, would it suddenly make this arguement moot?
