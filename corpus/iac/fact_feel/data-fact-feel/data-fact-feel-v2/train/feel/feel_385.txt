I guess we just have different approaches then. To me a candidate should be held to questioning and challenged about any public policy issue, even publicly, rather than put a 'team mentality' first and not challenge them on a stance because of already wanting them in office--I tend to decide whether I want someone in office AFTER doing those things rather than before, and let such challenges play a part in whether or not I put my support behind them. An election is the time one SHOULD challenge them, not after they're in office and there's nothing that can so easily be done about it.
