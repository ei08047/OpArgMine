That's your argument? "Just surrender your guns now, you can still get them illegally later on?" That's the dumbest argument I've heard yet since Galileo's argument of "Just go ahead and register your guns now, if the police want them they'll confiscate them whether they're registered or not."
Also, in this sentence you just admitted that gun bans are useless. You said that people could easily acquire bans after they were banned. So you're admitting what Great Britain did was a useless tactic that can't have any beneficial results.
