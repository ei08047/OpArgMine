yes, and i suppose an idea of perfection can exist, in a thinker's mind, and subjective to the thinker's standards of perfection. i could also point out that an imperfect thinker, with no reference or standard of "objective" perfection, is incapable of having a perfect idea of anything. therefore the argument falls apart at the first premise, since an "idea of perfection" cannot exist, unless the thinker himself is perfect, which would make him God by his own definition.
