What a laugh!!! From what I've heard, Supersort here went running with his tail behind his legs (or maybe it was that he was banned, I forget - that might have been one of the other boards). The thread over there is a compilation of the over half-dozen debate boards SS has been preaching his ignorance on, usually reusing his arguments on each board and then leaving once they get disproved and torn apart to go on to another board and preach some more of the same exact ignorance. It really is very sad.
