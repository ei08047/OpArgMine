Thats a rather shaky argument. In some place felons do vote. Our own fast eddie has them getting signed up while in prison. If you take a right and question it, then it is no longer a right. It has become a defacto privilige. If it was up to me, criminals would have their own sanctuary away from the law abiding after they serve their time.
