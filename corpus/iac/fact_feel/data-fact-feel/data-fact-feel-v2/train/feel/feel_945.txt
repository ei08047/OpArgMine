So lets say that if, and I know this has nothing to do with the topic of gay marriage, but do the people have a right to amend the constitution to introduce slavery? Does the majority have a right to deny a minority freedom? I already know you answer. You believe in the tyranny of the majority.
Why do you want the people to vote to take other people marriages away? I do not understand your reasoning on this. Besides you have never answered my question.
Do you have any compassion?
