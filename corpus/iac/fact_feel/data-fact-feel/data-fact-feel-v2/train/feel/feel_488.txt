I think this is the crux of our disagreement. In my line of reasoning, I believe since criminals are obviously using firearms, the refusal to allow lawful citizens the same means of defense is unreasonable and unfair.
Good people are required to "bring a knife to a gunfight". (i.e. disproportionate response)
While I believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to have access to the means to defend themselves, I think a reasonable compromise is possible between our two sides.
How's this: 
Instead of a complete ban, you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection.
Instead of lassiz' faire "guns for all who want them", I'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase. (In the U.K. Although this is reasonable, I'm not going for it in the U.S. This would be a HUGE concession to government control here.)
A strict licencing/registration scheme would be allowing for MORE freedom in the U.K. It would be tightening a "Nazi-like" noose around our necks here in the U.S.
If you are being burned at the stake, lethal injection sounds like a wonderful alternative. If you are walking down the sidewalk, it's not quite as peachy.
