Confirmation records that you were a Christian? Excuse me while I fall out of my chair in uncontrollable fits of laughter. Did your pastor make you sign a paper that said "I, _________, have proudly become a Christian on ________ __, _____"? Or did they take pictures of you talking to Jesus in the youth room? 
Seriously though... no, wait, nevermind. *snicker*
