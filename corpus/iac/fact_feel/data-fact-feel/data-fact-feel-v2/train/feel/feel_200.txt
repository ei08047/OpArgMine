Oh I certainly don't pretend that and certainly didn't claim that either--though a couple of left-wing posters here (who will remain nameless for now) might take the bizarre step of saying my post to you amounted to as much, if history is any indicator. Maybe we'll all luck out and they'll forget their Lenses of Bias at home, and instead read claims people actually make.
