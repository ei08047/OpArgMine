Yes it is patent that you would assume that. Your wish to advertise this and tell the world, repeatedly must make you of some import.
Repeatedly you make this a personal issue. I have addressed posts and say 'another poster has said ...such and such'. But you insist that I address YOU in such posts.
Now you are going at it again, saying I'm not answering questions. This is an attempt to take the moral high-ground, and is itself highly deceitful, especially in light that you have in the past accused me of saying things that I didn't... see our discussions re: Archie, the transitional bird-beast.
Also, you name-call, and then chuck a tantrum if anyone does the same back.
I must say here that I do wish you'd stop personalising this, as it only leads to more confrontation, not discussion.
Calling people names is just grand-standing. It is the sort of behaviour that suggests someone who is just interested in making themselves heard, regardless of anyone else.
