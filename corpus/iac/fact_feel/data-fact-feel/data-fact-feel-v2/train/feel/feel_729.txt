That is merely your interpretation of my actions here, and does not reflect my personal motivations. You don't like it that I disagree with you, and from the options available to explain that disagreement you alternately choose 'Peeling is stupid/simple minded' and 'Peeling is driven by an emotional, philosophical imperative' - the former because it's always a handy and ego-inflating explanation for disagreement and you don't have any respect for other people's intellect anyway, and the latter because it's understandable and familiar to you.
I disagree with you because the logic you have used to prop up your assertion that your philosophy mirrors reality is clearly faulty. The evidence you provide to support your case actively harms it. It's not that you're certainly wrong, just that you don't have to be right for the evidence we see to add up. 
I don't think you're stupid by any means; the skill with which you have manipulated our discussions has been considerable. I do think you are ignorant of much that would beneficially inform your hypotheses, that you cherry-pick just that evidence which seems to support your preconceptions rather than critically applying your hypothesis to all the available evidence, and I do think that your intellect is being leveraged in pursuit of the wrong goal, namely the creation of a fortress of semantics, idiosyncratic terminology and untestable assertions from within which you can hurl abuse at others.
You may disagree with my assessment - fine. I am at least doing you the courtesy of believing you when you say you formulate EAM with the express intention of promoting your personal philosophical views about life.
