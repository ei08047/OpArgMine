I believe the Bible is correct in every detail. The difference is how those who read them choose to interpret their meaning. You, for instance, look at a verse that says the earth cannot be moved and take that to mean that the Bible says that the earth does not move PERIOD. I believe that that means that God is powerful enough to keep the earth from simply "flying out" of its orbit and rocketing off into space somewhere. Yes, I proudly "cling" to the idea that a flood covered the mountains. I believe fully in the ENTIRE Bible (unlike some people) and I DO NOT "pick and choose" what I believe.
