Sexually explicit material turning children into sex machines??? BWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA  We are ALREADY sexual. Humans come that way.  I do not comprehend this puritanical BS that simply knowing about sex is somehow an endangerment to our kids. What a load of XXXX. My kid has known about sex for years and is just find and still about as interested in girls as the average 11 year old. If they don't play video games or football they are of little use to him. I suspect that will change in a couple of years - but I shall blame puberty, not his knowledge of sex.  stupid people - they are freakin everywhere!
