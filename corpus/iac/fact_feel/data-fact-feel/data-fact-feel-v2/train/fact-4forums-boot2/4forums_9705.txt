Not if a judge rules in conflict with the instrument from which he derives his power to begin with. For example, expanding voting rights to 5 year olds would certainly expand freedom, but if a judge were to say that the constitution required expanding the vote to 5 year olds, then that would he wrong.  I like freedom very much. I also happen to like law and order very much. I simply cannot bring myself to either think or live according to a view that is fundamentally inconsistent and irrational, and which would lead to a republic where a written constitution does not posses any meaning at all.
