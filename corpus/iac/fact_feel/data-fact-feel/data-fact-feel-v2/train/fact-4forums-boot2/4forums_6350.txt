So Goddidit?  I see you still haven't gotten back to the thread where 'intelligent design' was shown to be nothing more then  we ignorant, therefore Goddidit.  Nor did you explain away how ID is any different then Animism.  If you took someone who lived in the jungle all his life, took some food, put it in a microwave and then served to him and asked him how the food got hot, what would you expect him to say?  Magic most likely as that has been the outcome of similar situations in the past. What we know to be a simple electromagnetic device is magic to him.  Just because we do not know does not mean God was responsible. If you think like that, then 10,000 years of human cognitive advancement has skipped you.
