You obviously got your opinions second hand. Read the sequel to Mein Kampf and you will never be able to say Hitler was not absolutely driven by Darwinism. At least not honestly.  If Hitler believed we were all God's children he could not have believed in evolution and therefore the master race or the need to attack America , or anyone for that matter.
