That isn't the arguement your buddy made. He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that.  Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master. He didn't mention how the snake felt  Also said something about robots and guns but didn't have any examples to wow us with. Do you?
