You are correct, but bear in mind it is just Bragg's introduction to the programme and not the opinion of the panel. This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.  Thanks for the links on the articles btw.
