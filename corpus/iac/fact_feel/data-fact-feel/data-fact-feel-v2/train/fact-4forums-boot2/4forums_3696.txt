We have a similar piece of legislation in the UK. Statute requires that every male over the age of 14 turn out at their local churchyard, on a Saturday, for two hours of longbow practice for the purposes of maintaining a functioning militia.  It's generally regarded as an anarchronism hereabouts. We did have a civil war in the meantime but somehow everyone who wanted to get involved managed to find themselves a weapon and it all turned out okay.  On the other hand, the statute that makes it legal to shoot a welshman with a bow and arrow if he's caught in sight of the city walls of Chester after midnight, should be protected with our collective dying breaths. Take away that right and who knows where it will end?
