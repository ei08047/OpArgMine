It&#8217;s a program about how the story could have gotten started. There is a scenario of how someone with a large boat that traded animals saw a large storm coming. He and his family grabbed everything they could and survived the flood. There are some scientist that give some interesting facts. It all sounded reasonable to me, or something like that.
