You and the others here probably would have been one of those people chanting before 9/11 that because a plane hadnt been flown into a building by terrorists it would never happen.  But looked what happenend.  Even one time is one times too many.  Here youre getting all upset again because someone talks about banning terrorists from 50 caliber rifles!
