Well, look who's all pompous about something, and still get it wrong. Either way, earth or universe, you are still wrong, as for many decades the age of the universe has been put in the high single digits to the teens. We have never claimed it was 4 billion years old, that would just be retarted, as that is the age of the earth. Maybe you should check your facts and make sure you don't get them wrong whentrying to argue about the subject.
