That explains Figure 6 of the following? Its a flood zone of a riverbed? How about other areas where there are trees growing through 2 separate coal seams?  Google Image Result for http://www.grisda.org/origins/images/24017-12.jpg  This helps make my point about review of evolutionary books. My personal review of this small part of some book explaining how the petrified forest came to be because of a riverbed elsewhere is a big thumbs down.  If that is the best you got I am looking elsewhere for answers. Shame on you for accepting that from your evolutionary high priest. Can you even see that no explanation was given?
