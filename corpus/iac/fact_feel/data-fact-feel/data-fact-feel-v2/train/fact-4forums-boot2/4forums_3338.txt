If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.
