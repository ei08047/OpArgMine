What pattern?  The numbers don't add up in your favor. There are millions of concealed carry holders who have done absolutely nothing wrong. More than 100,000 who behave themselves at all times, for every one that does something illegal.  In the world of math you lose.  How about every dead individual in Chicago, shot to death in a city that doesn't allow for handgun ownership? Have you no feelings for the victims of crime that were murdered because of the agendas you support?  You support the criminals being left armed while their intended victims have to wait ten days for the paperwork to clear before they can take possession of their private property.  Either point out the supposed cover ups, or shut up and go away.
