Ah the Accuracy International, a high quality, high cost precision weapon. Available in .308 Winchester, .338 Lapua, .300 Winchester Magnum, and 7mm Remington Magnum. Essentially nothing more than a common hunting rifle given a massive overhaul.  I don't know about that listed range, however. The maximum effective range listed is 800 meters. Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range, meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison.  Hard to say really. The boxes of common .22 rimfire ammunition I get say that they're dangerous out past a mile, and that's a tiny little cartridge suited for vermin.
