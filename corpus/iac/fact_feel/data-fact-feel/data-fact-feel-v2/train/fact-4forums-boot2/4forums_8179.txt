That could certainly explain a lot of our erratic, short-term political goals.  I've always felt that cocaine, with its mind-boggling profit factors and volume, was never declared #1 during the crack era because the money was so big payoffs had infiltrated law enforcement and legislative areas in such high positions of power that it was downplayed as a problem of Columbia and Peru. So we send troops to Columbia for fulfilling political agendas, pack our prisons with addicts and low level dealers and chase pot growers while cocaine management, other than a couple of high-profile cartels who threatened our puppet in Columbia, remained virtually untouched.
