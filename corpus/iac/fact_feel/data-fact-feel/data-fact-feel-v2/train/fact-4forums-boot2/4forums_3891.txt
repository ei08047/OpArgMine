What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes  conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms  per Heller.  If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift.
