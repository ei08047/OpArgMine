So you admit that the bible should be kept out of the hands of children? Is my statement about the bible somehow false? Is the brutal torture and murder of Jesus not glorified in the bible? Is a book that glorifies this type of activity proper reading material for a 5 year old. i bet Rep. Sally Kern would gladly let a five year old read about the brutal torture and murder of Jesus.
