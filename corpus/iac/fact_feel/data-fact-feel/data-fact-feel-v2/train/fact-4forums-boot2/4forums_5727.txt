The health care system in Canada has undergone a dramatic change in the past ten years.  The conservative (relatively for Canada, US  conservatives  are our  fascists ) governments have been cutting away at Health Care in a blatant attempt to destroy the system.  Canadians love having public health care. In order to try to sway people into accepting some degree of privatization, the politicians make Health budgets which are completely impossible- because of pressure from huge US medical insurance companies.
