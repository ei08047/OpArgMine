Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!  But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.  I don't see why not, it appears the most logical explanation to me.  You are right, it's not a nice thought. But then again little in life is. Why should this be any different?
