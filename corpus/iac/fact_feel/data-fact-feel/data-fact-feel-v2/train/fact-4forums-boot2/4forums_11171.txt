Well I'm not advocating this but technically doesn't the Constitution dictate than anyone from birth should be able to own a gun? The second amendment guarantees the right of everyone to bear arms (actually prohibits ANY restrictions against keeping and bearing arms) and the 14th amendment defines a citizen to be anyone born or naturalized in the US.
