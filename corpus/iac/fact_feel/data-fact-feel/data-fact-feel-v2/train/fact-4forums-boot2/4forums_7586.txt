The last Pope stated evolution was compatible with the Catholic faith as well, however he supported the theory with a twist. I believe he said that evolution happened until roughly 6,000 years ago and then God intervened, creating Adam and Eve. Thereby attempting to nullify the fact we are descended from other animals.  Does this new infallible Pope agree with the previous infallible Pope?
