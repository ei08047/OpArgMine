So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?  If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?  What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?  What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?  If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?  You are confusing me. Please explain.
