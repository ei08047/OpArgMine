I think the point that can safely be made to all of you defenders of atheism and the Governments that practice it is that all of the people who have wrongly died at the hands of the corrupt Popes and the RCC throughout history in the name of Christ don't come close to the deaths caused by the Godless dictators who practiced genocide as shown by ChristAscended. That is the point he is making and that point stands.
