SNIP  This opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an  assault weapons ban  because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.
