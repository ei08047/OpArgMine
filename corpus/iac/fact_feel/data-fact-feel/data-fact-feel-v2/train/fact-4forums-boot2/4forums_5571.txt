A SWAT officer, a member of the  best of the best  team as far as police forces go, left a weapon behind where it could've been snatched up by any two bit criminal and used on a crime spree as people were mowed down by true automatic firepower.  Those of you who believe that only the military and police should have guns, you just got a kick in the teeth from this incident occurring. So quit ragging on private citizens who aren't  perfect  as far as you're concerned.
