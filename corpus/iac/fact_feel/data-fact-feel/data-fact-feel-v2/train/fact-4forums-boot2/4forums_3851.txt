No, because it would have been the actions of only one man, Adam. It wasn't just one tribe that evolved into humans - it would be hundreds of inviduals inacting with each other and the environment. Also the trouble is that there wouldn't have been a concious mutation (that would have occured somewhere at the frog level if not before), its not conciousness that is humanity's unique talent - its the level of pattern recognition and abstract thinking. Its not even really a unique talent, just a much more complicated version of what pretty much everything else has - where the line is going to be drawn for the purposes of a Fall is going to get difficult.  Unless of course you start taking sections merely as metaphors and in some cases purely primative myth, whilst still beleiving the general messages. But then if you do that then you are on logically shaky ground but never had a problem with evolution in the first place.
