I think it would be an exception as well.  But if you see an indicator that might point to an  exception , I think the question should be asked.  Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.  If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?  Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.
