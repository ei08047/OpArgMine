ever notice that the mass shootings tend to occure in places where it is illegal for people to defend them selves with there legal firearm? the last one that tryed that was shot dead by a  church security guard  (person with a conseled carry permit, that volenterred to bring it with her to services).  how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport.
