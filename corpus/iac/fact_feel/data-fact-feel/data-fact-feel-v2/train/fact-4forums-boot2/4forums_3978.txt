Huh, what is more important?  The constant messages of acceptance, tolerance and love in the bible, far too numerous to count  OR  The few and far inbetween (what tops 3?) vague passages possibly about homosexuality.  I used to go to church and my pastor (a woman by the way) kept stressing that the important things in the bible are the ones that are repeated time and time again.  Obviously the UCC understands this but many people here don't.
