Rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.  The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.
