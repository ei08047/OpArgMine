Actually if you were educated in history you would know that Hitler was an evolutionists. If you got that simple trivial thing wrong, why should I trust you in things that I do not know? Atheistic evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith acknowledged of Hitler: The Germal Fuhrer ... is an evolutinoist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of eolution.  ~ Keith, A., 1947.  Evolution and Ethics , Putman, New York, p.230.Don't worry, some of my friends didn't know either. If evolution is true, than it should have some reasonable explanation as to why we have morals, but it doesn't.
