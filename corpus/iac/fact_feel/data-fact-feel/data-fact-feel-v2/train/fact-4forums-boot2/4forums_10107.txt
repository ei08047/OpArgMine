the FOPA did more than stop the ATF from excepting new machenegun tax stamps, it also established a provision for transporting a weapon through jurstitions, a clarification of prohibited persons, and prohibits a redgestry of non-NAF weapons to be keept. so we do not want to toss the entire law.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm...Protection_Act  i think he would have to restart at the bottem of the court system, he was fighting the charges under the idea that the interstate commers cluse did not apply to a home made weapon. so to chalange it under a diffrent defence i would think he would be starting over.
