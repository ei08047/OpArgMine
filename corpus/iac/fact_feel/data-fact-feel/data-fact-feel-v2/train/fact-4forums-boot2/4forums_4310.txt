Because Christianity has already proven to be a lie and completely absurd, all of the legislated morality on it is invalid.  Do you, ChristAscended, see a problem with relying on a unproven assertion for your debate? Where you relied on assuming falsely that evolution has been disproved, my example relies on Christanity already being proven to be false as well. Neither your or my underlying assumption is true. Therefore, you cannot create a meaningful or even valid discussion based on something that is merely conjecture, especially when it comes to ethics.
