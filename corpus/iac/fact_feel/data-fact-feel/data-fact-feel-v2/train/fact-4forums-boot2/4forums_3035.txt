I know I have told you this before but a trimester has no science meaning in it at all. It is simply just a term to say  3 months . I'm not sure how a man-made time split can be used to determine who is an isnt' a person...but maybe you can explain this.  Perhaps you could just say  Thanks for helping but I don't think that is what it means  instead of flaming.
