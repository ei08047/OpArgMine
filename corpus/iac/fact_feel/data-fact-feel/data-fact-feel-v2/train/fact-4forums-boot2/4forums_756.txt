Here's a quote from mayr regarding selection,   Only relatively few individuals in a given generation would qaulify and survive the selection procedure. That small sample would be able to preserve only a small amount of the whole variance of the parental population. Such survival selection would be highly restrained.  What Evolution Is. pg. 118  So....do you evolutionists agree with this? Let's take humans. Are only a few people in this generation  fit  enough to go on to breed? Is Mayr smoking crack or what?????? This theory is pathetic.
