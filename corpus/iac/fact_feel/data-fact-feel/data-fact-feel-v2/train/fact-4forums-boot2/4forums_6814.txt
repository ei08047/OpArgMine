That's incorrect. The Constitution begins with Article 1 which does not contain the Bill of Rights. The Constitution contains seven articles which are followed by the Bill of Rights and the rest of the amendments. If you really are from England as you claim then I guess your lack of knowledge about the American Constitution is understandable.
