No, this is more of an ethical stand point. A fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then why is it an outrage by others to begin with? The only party that stakes out a vital rule in condemning abortion is the fetus...and unfortunately for that minority the fetus is a neutral party.  However clinical signs of life do define us as a living person. Not conception. So no living people is being aborted...at least in the majority of abortion cases.
