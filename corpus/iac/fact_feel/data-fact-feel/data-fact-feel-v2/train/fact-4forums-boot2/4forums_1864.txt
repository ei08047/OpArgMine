It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small.  By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.
