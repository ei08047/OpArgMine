I'm the first! I'm the first!  This was an interesting idea that you had  the other day ? Something like that would have taken me a month or more to develop. Perhaps you were using a figure of speech.  I'm going to have to read it all again (without the single malt) to be sure, but I think that you presented a fair representation of IDCreationism and then body slammed and pinned it. Your piece was short but to the point.  In saying that you did present a fair representation of IDCreationism, you also managed to reveal a ruse of ID. XXXXXX presume that CSI is the result of specified complexity which is the result of design which is the result of an intelligent being. That's actually pretty meaningless. The source of the information in the genome of any organism is the environment in which it lives. If you have doubts, make a significant change to that environment. Put your tropical, fresh water fish into a salt water tank. Or do the reverse with your salt water fish.  Creationists of any ilk fail to understand the power of the environment in acting on genetic diversity over time.
