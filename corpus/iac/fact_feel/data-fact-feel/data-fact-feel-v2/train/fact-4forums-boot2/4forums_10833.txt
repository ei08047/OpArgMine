I think that if for arguments sake that if Darwin was a racist that carried out genocides then I still don't see what Macroevolution would have to do with it. I will say it again. If you start with the mistaken belief some people are inferior then Eugenics immediately seems reasonable since it only relies on the idea that some people are inferior and the fact that parents are like their offspring.
