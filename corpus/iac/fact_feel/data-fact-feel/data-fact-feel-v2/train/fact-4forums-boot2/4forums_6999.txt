Yes, the mythology has been around for a long time. Most cultures had their own. You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews. You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind. But the technology and the techniques to use that technology didn't develop until about 400 years ago. Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation. About 150 years ago, Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change. About the same time, Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring. That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation. They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made. But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century. It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism. It actually became popular in the 1960's.
