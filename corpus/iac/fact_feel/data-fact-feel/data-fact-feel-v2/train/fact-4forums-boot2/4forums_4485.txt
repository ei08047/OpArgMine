Here's their official website, Oath Keepers Oath Keepers ? Guardians of the Republic Can anyone point out any real and present danger they represent as a radical or dangerous group which appears to be a threat to the American Way from any of their literature at all? In fact, doesn't it concern you greatly that organizations in America today would be so far LEFT that they would consider what this organization represents to be any type of threat at all?  Can the thread starter support his perceived concern from anything their web site actually says?
