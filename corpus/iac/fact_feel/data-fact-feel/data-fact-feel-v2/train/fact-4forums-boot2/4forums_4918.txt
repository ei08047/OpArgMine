Go to the range shoot a little, hunt a little, and sit around and talk. We talk about wives, girlfriends, children, family, cars, fishing, politics, and of course guns and hunting.  We do not talk about robbing banks, raping women, stealing cars, selling drugs, or killing cops.  The gun owners here are HARMLESS and productive members of society. Felons are not.  The law must focus on the bank robbers, rapist, car jackers, dealers, and cop killers; and not on the harmless gun owners. That is why gun control as it is envisioned and practiced in this country is fundamentally wrong.
