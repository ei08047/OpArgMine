Well, I`ve always seen denmark to have a rather high level of political, economic, social and religous freedom (the only real detriment is high taxes, but some would argue that high taxes coupled with a large amount of income distribution actualy increases economic freedom, so its kind of ambigous). This being mixed with relative socialistic and prosperous economy makes Denmark a good contestant for the title  the land of the free .
