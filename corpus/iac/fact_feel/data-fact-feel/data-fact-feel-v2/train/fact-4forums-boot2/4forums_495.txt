This is a common creationist trick. Jonathan Wells has two PhD's, one in Molecular and Cell Biology, the other in Religious Studies. Jonathan Wells works for, or affiliated with (it's difficult to know for sure) The Discovery Institute. This is a pro  Intelligent Design  (ie Biblical Creationism by stealth) organisation based in Seattle in the USA. It spends around $1 million a year promoting  Intelligent Design  and attempting to rubbish evolution.  I'm not suggesting that Jonathan Wells is inherently wrong; I'm just pointing out that he is far from  objective and neutral  on this subject.
