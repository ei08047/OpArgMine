Thanks!  There's a petrified forest in Mississippi also. I don't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces, but I'll find out next trip.  I'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature. Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth?  Likely, the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen. Other inert gases could have done the same.
