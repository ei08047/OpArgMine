The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.
Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.
Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.
And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.
I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.
