And better yet, ask Sinjin what he and his cohorts are doing to teach gun safety? How much did he and or the Anti-gun orgs spend? The NRA spent more then 20 MILLION Dollars to teach children to STOP! DON'T TOUCH, LEAVE THE AREA, TELL AN ADULT!
The NRA probably could and would do more however, EVEN JUST THAT, is called indoctrination by the Anti-gun crowed, and apparently even Sinjin! So is the criticism fair? Is the comparison he made fair?
