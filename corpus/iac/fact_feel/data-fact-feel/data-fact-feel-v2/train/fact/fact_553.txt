Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.
I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. 
But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!
