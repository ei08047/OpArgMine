Hi NATO, I agree that irresponsible industrial pollution is damaging the environment and would never deny that at all. Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes, streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks. So this reality goes without saying in my opinion.
But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself. That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself, then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here. That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself. But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place.
So we must make the distinction between environmental pollution and air pollution clear because the Global Warming fraud is based specifically on the claim that air pollution is changing our weather and warming the planet, since all of the scientific evidence belies that claim.
