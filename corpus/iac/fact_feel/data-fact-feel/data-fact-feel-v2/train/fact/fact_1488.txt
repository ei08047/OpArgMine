Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. "bacteria, birds etcs."
Natural selection occures frequently. You can "observe" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.
Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good.
