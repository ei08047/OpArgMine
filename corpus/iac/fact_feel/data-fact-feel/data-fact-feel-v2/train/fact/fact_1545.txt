Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.
