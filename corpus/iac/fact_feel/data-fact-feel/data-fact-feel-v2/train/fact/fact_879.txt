if God, even a non-biblical God, existed, then would you say that he would have always existed? wouldnt this God be the same and consistent throughout eternity? so far, we agree that the existence of a documented/biblical God cannot be proven. an undocumented/non-biblical God has never even been encountered, not even in the last 5000 years when the other Gods were being written about. if this God had the ability to make himself known at his perogative, why would he not do so until now? and if he doesnt show himself/make his existence known now why would he wait until later? we could extrapolate this forever, and this undocumented/non-biblical God would never "choose to" manifest. therefore, the existence of such a God can never be proven
the same applies for 3. if such a God never "decides to" manifest his presence, then even if he exists it would be of absolutely no consequence to mankind at all
