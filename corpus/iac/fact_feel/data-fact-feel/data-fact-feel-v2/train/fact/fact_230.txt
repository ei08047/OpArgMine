And pro-"choice" doesn't distort? That alone shows an unreasonable look on the issue.
I agree that many are uneducated about the subject (which helps the pro-choicers I might add) and I think many that get an abortion are not educated about whether or not it is morally ok to do. Many have just grown up with it and assumed it to be ok (which neither side of the issue should support...there is nothing wrong with education on an issue).
