It isn't possible to tell. What is called the "scientific" approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities, a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past, all well and good for the physical sciences, where the way particles behave does not change, but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people, that may react in ways totally unanticipated.
Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.
So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot? When it fails, just say "oops, well, we had good intentions, we can't be blamed". If that's all we have to work with, we are truly screwed. There are however, alternative ways of deciding whether you should do something to trying to predict its outcome.
