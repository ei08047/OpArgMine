Great insight and response to him. I too had my doubts about the veracity of the global warming claims at every level of the propaganda they have spewed from so many different sources, for so long. And those very sources have been exposed as participants in this scam now, which just makes my decade... emoticonXHoho Here's a link to a link I posted in the debate about the scam of carbon credits right here on 4forums back in January of 08, and an excerpt from that article. Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam. It's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter.
