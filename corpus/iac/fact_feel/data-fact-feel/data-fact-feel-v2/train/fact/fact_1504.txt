And to deny that there are no transitionals without having the integrity to at least making an effort to learn what you are talking about is ridiculous. There are lots of transitional fossils. Museums are full of them and more are being discovered on an almost daily basis. There are news stories that report them all over the place. Try reading At the Water's Edge: Fish with Fingers, Whales with Legs, and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea by Carl Zimmer. It will tell you about two transitional series. Also read Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight by Pat Shipman for the story of what we can learn from even limited transitional specimens and why. Also read The Mistaken Extinction: Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds by Lowell Dingus and Timothy Rowe. I found the book excellent even though recent finds of feathered dinosaurs have made some of the material a bit dated. It will give you an idea of how the fossil record fits together. At least you might learn what a transitional is.
