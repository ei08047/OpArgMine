No. That's the hypothesis. A theory has been tested. That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.
From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory.
