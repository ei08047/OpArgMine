But the point is that the Razor should not be used to test hypotheses! That isn't what Ockham stated the Razor as. The whole point is that you can't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing. In the example, impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement. Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon.
The Razor states that the animal was struck. Period. From that observations you make hypotheses as to what struck the animal. Hi_Its_Me listed only 2 of the possible hypotheses. Then, without testing either hyopothesis, he eliminated one as "unlikely" and used "unlikely" to = false. But there was not testing. Yet testing is not only possible but easy. Last year my daughter's car hit a deer. The deer's carcass wasn't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it. Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire. That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis. (Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire. However, that ad hoc hypothesis can't be independently tested and is therefore invalid).
