What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. The
only difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brains
of all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the 
production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,
evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.
