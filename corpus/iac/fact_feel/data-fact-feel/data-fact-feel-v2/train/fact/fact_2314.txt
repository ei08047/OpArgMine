Just by being something man made, this cannot be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God. For example, life, liberty, and property. I understand that many people do not have health insurance. It sucks, and everyone knows it. It is not a right, it is a good. Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand, well in our capitalist society. This is an expensive good, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it. That is just the way it goes, there are ways to fix it, there are ways to make it cost less, but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try. Unless, God makes it a right, it is not one.
