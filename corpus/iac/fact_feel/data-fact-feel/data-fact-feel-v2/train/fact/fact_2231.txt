And a lot of people are made uncomfortable by a presence of a mother breastfeeding her baby in public. You can't simply let standards of discomfort rule and guide the course of law. There's no constitutional or human right to be free of discomfort and not intimidated. 
If you're intimidated by somebody walking a large, powerful looking dog that could probably break your arm in its mouth, should we take steps to prevent such dogs from being owned, or walked in places where other people are present?
I'm sure if you look you can find plenty of women who are uncomfortable in the presence of black men, for whatever reason. Should we take action to free them of their discomfort?
