So you only class an abortion as something that occurs 8 weeks after conception?
That's your line to draw. However, I doubt you could persuade many courts that 'looking like a human' was a valid qualifier for being a person.
Everyone draws the line somewhere - be it conception, birth, or some point in between the two (if not before or after, in some cases). That doesn't mean that their version of 'the line' should automatically be the legal one. At the moment (in the UK, at least), that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable; that is, when it could potentially survive a premature birth. Before that point, everyone can choose their own qualifiers.
You can argue that the line should be legally redrawn... but I doubt 'looking like a human' will be considered the strongest of arguments.
