Well, let's think about that for a moment. The earth's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg, and that's if we count all of it, right up to the troposphere. Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg, almost a thousand times greater.
So even if the heat from the emerging floodwaters was dissipated into the entire atmosphere, the water would only be cooled by about 0.1 degrees before atmospheric temperatures reached equilibrium and no more cooling could occur.
