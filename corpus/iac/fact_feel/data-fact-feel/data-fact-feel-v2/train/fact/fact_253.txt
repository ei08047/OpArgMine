You speak as if these two things are mutually exclusive, they are not. Government control of guns only works on those willing to obey the law. Government cannot control criminals, they can and should however punish them when they catch them.
Allow me to ask you a question: Which is more important a perceived saftey via government control or the freedoms endowed by our creator and enumerated in the bill of rights?
I asked you before (you didn't answer) what rights are you willing to give up for what you perceive as a safer life? You once posted that you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, as it could be argued that religion has killed more people then cancer would you be willing to give up that freedom? How about if the government said you can own a Bible but not a Koran? Or you could only buy one religios text per month?
