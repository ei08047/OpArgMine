I learned a few things from the post. The author claimed "most households donâ€™t have guns". According to 1997 stats, 25% of ALL US adults owned firearms. If you assume that there are typically two adults per household, that means 50% of households have guns, so the statement is false.
On a personal note, someone tried to break into my brother's apartment shortly after he was married. He quickly opened the door, yelled "freeze MFer or I'll XXXX your head off!" while holding a short-barrelled shotgun and watched the perp #### himself. being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun, my brother didn't call the cops to report this self-defensive use of a firearm.
