That's just great. You think it is cruel to abort a fetus when the life of the mother is in danger. So what your really saying is: "Oh just let the chick die, save that baby". It strikes me as strange that you don't think letting that woman die would be cruel, or that the baby growing up without his mother would be cruel. And there would be no reason to do it to a "born baby". If they are already born, you cannot perform an abortion. And I think it is sickening that in this so called "land of the free" that there would even be an argument against an abortion done to prevent the death of the mother, or abortions done in the case of rape. I would think that the land of the free and the right to choose would go hand in hand. And let me ask you, with your demented, self righteous views, do you celebrate your birth date or your conception date?
