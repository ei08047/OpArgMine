Well, yeah, of course. Put some DNA in a dish and it won't do very much at all; it's not exactly news that the surrounding developmental machinery is significant too. We're just in the process of establishing to what degree that machinery is 'general purpose', and to what degree it encodes specific traits.
The rest of your post just goes completely off the rails. Nowhere does the article mention DNA (or anything else for that matter) being designed to suit the purposes of the organism, so I'm not sure why you're getting so excited.
