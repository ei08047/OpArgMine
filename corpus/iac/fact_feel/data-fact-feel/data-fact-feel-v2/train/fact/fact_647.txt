So you made the point on the interpretation of a legal document. The point is it is okay to illegalise abortion regardless of the reasons for doing so. Thinking outside of our current example can you not see the glaring problem with such an approach? I hope you can because the consequences of accepting such a philosophy are dire indeed.
However, returning to our original point, that being the former part of the proposed Bill's title I'd like some supporting evidence. I have pointed out the issue's with Steeeeve's citation, so hope you have something else to offer.
