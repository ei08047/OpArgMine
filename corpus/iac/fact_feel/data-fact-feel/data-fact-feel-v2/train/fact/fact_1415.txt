As above, 'social classes' are 'populations', and modern darwinian evolution focuses entirely on the 'evolution' of 'populations', NOT individual organisms. Neo-Lamarkian theory focuses on individual, internally driven effort, instead of inherited advantage, which is the be-all and end-all of Darwinism, and of modern economic and political social theory. Just as it has always been.
