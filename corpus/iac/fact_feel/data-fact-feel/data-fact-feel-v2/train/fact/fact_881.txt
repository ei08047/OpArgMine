Well, it happens in virtually every thread.
Some disagreements are between individuals of essentially the same basic system [Protestant Christian vs Protestant Christian], [atheist rationalist vs atheist rationalist]. 
Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems. In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things.
What is “evidence”? Well, that will depend on your core belief system. Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system, but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue, the Christian says “That’s not evidence!”.
One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect, so they really have no evidence for their position.
