Actually, it can. The zygote doesn't always develop into an adult human being. In fact, about 60-70% of all zygotes never implants or gets rejected and end up being flushed down the toilet. And of those who do implant, some turn into blighted ovums or hydatidiform moles. So no, your claim is not as all-encompassing as you want to present it.

Which is also true after ANY cell division of any kind, and as such again is a rather meaningless point.
