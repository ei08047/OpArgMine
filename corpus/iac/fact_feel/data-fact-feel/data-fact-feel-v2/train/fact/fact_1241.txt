On the flip side, you should never let anyone force you into carrying out a pregnancy you do not want.
as for planned parenthood vs doctors, planned parenthood counselors are required to give you unbiased information and referrals, as far as i know, a doctor is not required to do either. Just because you do not like the work that planned parenthood does, it gives you no right to malign them or their employees. You have never proved that these people are anything but compassionate and qualified care givers and medical professionals.
