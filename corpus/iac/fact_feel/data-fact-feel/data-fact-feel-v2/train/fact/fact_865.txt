He was at various different observatories.
I've never heard of Mt. Carmel. 
He worked at Lick and Palomar. (Wait I think Lick is on Mt. Carmel maybe?)
Who cares.
When and where was he BARRED from using these telescopes?
Please provide a link.
When and where was he BARRED from presenting his evidence?
Please provide a link.
He published plenty of papers and he even has websites and books.
But, he only had a few images supporting his hypohtesis that quasars are ejecta from odd galaxies. They also had many various doubts associated with them.
If he had presented hundreds of examples of these things that had no other explanation they would have taken it more seriously (not that these things weren't taken seriously since they were).
He didn't. No one else has come across these things other than one or two that I am aware of, and these are also explained away.
He wasn't fired for just suggesting that the BB was wrong.
If so he would have been fired in the sixties.
I don't even think he was fired but I haven't found info on this.
I found this page though:
