Knowledge itself is a limited commodity. To make a claim that everything is knowable is a statement that is impossible to prove; Scientism makes this claim. Closely related to it is Objectivism.
"Scientism, in the strong sense, is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful, which is not a scientific claim and hence, if true, not meaningful."
