As I said earlier, it is garbage. He can't back it up. As a scientist-in-training, you know that real science requires research and evidential support. supersport has neither. The "support" that he cites -- when read in their entirety -- do little or nothing to actually support him. On one forum (mentioned earlier on this forum), the author of the scientific paper that supersport cited actually joined the board to tell supersport to stop misrepresenting his research.
The only "agenda" that the scientific community has is to find the truth. The fact that the scientific community trounces supersport's points nonstop is not what makes his points wrong; his points are wrong on their own merit, and they'd be wrong regardless of anybody's refutations of them.
