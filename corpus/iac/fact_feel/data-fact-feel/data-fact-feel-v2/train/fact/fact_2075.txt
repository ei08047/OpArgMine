For the final compilation, yes, but the vast majority, certainly the Gospels and the first few Pauline epistles, were widely accepted long before that, and were regarded as authoritative in the early 2nd century. By all means quibble about 2 Peter, Hebrews and Revelation but don't try to claim the books of the Bible were selected politically in the 4th century, it simply doesn't fit the facts.
