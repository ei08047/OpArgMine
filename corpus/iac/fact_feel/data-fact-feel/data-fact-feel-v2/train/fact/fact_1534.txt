It is not speculation. When the 2nd Amendment was written, modern military weapons were flint lock rifles. The whole purpose of the 2nd Amendment was so common people could fight off a state armed with modern military weapons.
Today the weapons have changed, but the need or the intent has not.
The 2nd Amendment does not mean we fight a tyrannical government with flint lock rifles.
