What? Sinjin Dude! Your devotion to the Democratic Party, and sticking up for your guy is admarable, but come on! It says "In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States."
Are you calling the author a liar? Are you accusing him of journalistic fraud? If this is true, you should be. You know, if agent William Newell did not actually say that, this author will be fired. William Newell himself will tell every other news outlet that he did not say that! 
Are you, perhaps, a bit too zealous in standing up for your guy? 
Maybe you will watch this carefully, and post the story if his firing, or at the very least, his retraction. Or perhaps William Newell's statement condemning this Journalistic Fraud, if that is what it is. Man would THAT help your credibility right now. But alas, that retraction, that statement nor his firing will ever come. 
Although, it sure has been fun watching you dig yourself into a hole, and shred your credibility over this ATF. Obama and Obama cabinet or whom ever, Exaggeration in order to Ban Assault Weapons!
It's OK Sinjin. The American people already know! emoticonXSmilie Senator John Kerry was the one who let this (What is the word? uh) discrepancy out of the bag.
  Kerry qoute
