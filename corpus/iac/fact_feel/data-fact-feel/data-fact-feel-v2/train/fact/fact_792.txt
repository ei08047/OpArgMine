Not realy they are still being manufactured for civilian use and are legal in most states even in states where machine guns are not allowed. You would be actualy supprised at how available they are. You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state. All thats needed is to get your chief law enforcment officer to sign your fourm 4, pay $200 to BATFE, pass an FBI back ground chk and wait appx. 2 mo's and you have one.
