No it doesn't. Changes in allele frequencies in a population over time were observed. That is an example of evolution. Evolution isn't something that is "proved." It is observed. Populations of organisms change over time due to the changing frequiencies of genetic make up. That is observed. Evolutionary biology tries to explain the reasons for the observed evolution. In the case of the peppered moth, natural selection due to the predation of birds has been proposed.
