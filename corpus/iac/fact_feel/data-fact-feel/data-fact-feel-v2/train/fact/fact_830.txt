Since that would be me let's go over my position and you tell me which parts aren't reasonable and why:
1. I've advocated registration of all handguns but not all guns. 
2. I've advocated mandatory secure storage for unattended firearms, like when you're not home.
3. I've advocated photographing and fingerprinting for all handgun purchases.
