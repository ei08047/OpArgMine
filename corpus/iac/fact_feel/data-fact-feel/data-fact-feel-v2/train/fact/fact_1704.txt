Well to start its a theory not a notion. Secondly if everybody already agreed on common ancestry with modification as the means whereby the species arose then why did anyone every think Darwin had anything new and novel. Simple explanation is he explained HOW such descent might be accomplished in a rational and testable context and provided significant evidence and analysis supporting his scheme. In other words his basic scheme coheres while the alternatives fail to do so.
