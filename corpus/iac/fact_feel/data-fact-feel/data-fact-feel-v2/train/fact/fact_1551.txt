The statement was made in an address to the Pontifical Acacemy of Sciences in 1996. It is clear that the Pope considers the theory of evolution to be valid. However, this is not a an encyclical and not a statement ex cathedra. Therefore it is not a statement of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. However, he is stating that, recognizing a restriction, the theory of evolution does not contradict Christian faith. He reaffirmed the statement made by Pius XII of that restriction. They is, "If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God."
So yes. Catholics may be theistic evolutionists, evolutionary creationists or ID creationists. I suppose they can even fit into the other categories. I have known some YEC Catholics.
