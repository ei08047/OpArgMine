Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!
As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth. Till then I will claim that such a transformation cannot be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome. I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand. emoticonXGood
