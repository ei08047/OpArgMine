(Sorry to hear you lost an hour's worth of work... I hate it when that happens!)
I may not have made this clear, but here are the facts:
1) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization. It is pointless to argue this fact, because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable. The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. Period.
2) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being' or a 'person.' These are not scientific terms. It is impossible to 'prove' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being.' The argument could be made, for example, that a 'being' must have some sort of self-awareness. It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness.
So, to answer your question, regardless of what anyone believes, a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on.
My question to you: What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being' that deserves 'personhood' according to the law?
