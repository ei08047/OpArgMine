Again you focus on irrelevant minutia in the hope of making excuses and justifying the actions of someone who was clearly in the wrong. Here again is what the Judges said in their ruling, one being a fellow woman whom you are calling a racist, and it doesn't bode well for your law suit partial criminal: But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.
The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: "It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation."
