I think reason why the "hypothesis validated" card has been played here is because:
1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.
2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected "transitional" form.
3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.
Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.
Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated ;)
I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled.
