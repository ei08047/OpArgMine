Actually, Darwin didn't like the phrase "survival of the fittest" applied to his theory. The phrase was actually coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer in the statement of his social theories. Darwin's preferred phrase was "natural selection" and used the phrase "survival of the fittest" only after it had become popular and Alfred Wallace (a Christian turned spiritualist) convinced Darwin that he would avoid confusion by using it. If one wants to reduce the hundreds of pages of theory that Darwin wrote to a single sound bite, "differential reproductive success" is probably the best. Further, natural selection was a proposed mechanism to explain the observed divergence of species.
Darwin was quite aware of the implications of his theory for mankind from the beginning. He was also aware that it would be unpopular with the Church and the religious so he didn't mention it in On the Origin of Species. He waited until the theories expressed in that book had become generally accepted in the scientific community and then published The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. In the later book Darwin did argue that mankind shared a common ancestor with apes.
