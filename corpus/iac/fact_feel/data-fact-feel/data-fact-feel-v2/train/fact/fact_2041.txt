EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WRONG!
Wow, you're even wrong when yoget away from your precious Bible and try to sound scientific.
there is no such thing as the "Canid species". You are so bloody wrong it isn't even funny. "Canid" (or rather Canis) referrs to the GENUS, the WORD FOLLOWING IT referrs to SPECIES. 
Perhaps you should head back to school and learn some simple biological classification/taxonomic ranking.
