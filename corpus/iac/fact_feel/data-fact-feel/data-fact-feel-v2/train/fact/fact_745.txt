No. She (Ohioprof) is saying that for a person to not look like a complete disgusting hypocrite while arguing against gay marriage on the basis of "defending Traditional(TM) Marriage", that person must not engage in behaviours diametrically opposed to said "Traditional(TM) Marriage". The strawman you are attempting to construct is just that - a strawman.
As to "the majority of Americans are against gay marriage", who really gives a flying emoticonXCensored? The majority of Americans thought that slavery was acceptable, that blacks and whites shouldn't marry, that "seperate-but-equal" policies were acceptable (and equal), that women should not have equal rights as men, that discrimination on the basis of gender, race, etc. was acceptable, and on and on. The "majority of Americans" have been for a whole lot of pretty emoticonXCensoreding stupid things. Your argument isn't helped whatsoever with your appeal to majority.
