End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.
First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm
The more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.html
These documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.
