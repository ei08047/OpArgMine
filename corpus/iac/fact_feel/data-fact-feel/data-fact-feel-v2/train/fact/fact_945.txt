That doesn't prove the government shouldn't be armed. It's not like one politician can single-handedly kill millions of people. In fact, if the whole U.S. Congress one day decided to get up from their offices and try to invade a small town called Kittanning, Pennsylvania, they would fail. What it does prove that the government takes guns away because they don't trust the little people. We should all start wondering "why not?"
