It is also a desperate tactic because there are no other intelligent arguments. It is really a "non-tactic", and merely just a re-statement of their position: "I am opposed to changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples in the marriage laws because that would change the definition."
It is semantically indistinguishable from saying, "I don't like the idea of same-sex marriage."
When objectively assessing the pros and cons, there are no valid arguments against same-sex marriage, except for biblical admonitions (which are not really objective, anyway.)
