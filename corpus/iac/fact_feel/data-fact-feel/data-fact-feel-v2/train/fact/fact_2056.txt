Actually, there is no such thing as "an evolutionary mutation of a gene." A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.
Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?
