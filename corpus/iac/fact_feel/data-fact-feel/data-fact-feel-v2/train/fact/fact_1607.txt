What difference would that make? The BATFE (E for explosives, their power grows) already knows you own a firearm if you've ever had a NICS check. They're supposed to destroy the records, but who knows what they do? Might as well let it be known you have some personal experiance in this area. Gives you better grounds for debate than 'Joe Foreigner' who has never owned or possibly even seen a real firearm in person. Being part of the crowd and looking in from the outside make big differences when it comes to understanding.
