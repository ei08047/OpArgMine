"Iraq, one of the most heavily armed countries in the world, is believed to harbor enough guns to arm every one of its 24 million citizens. Iraqi civilians also have access to other light weapons, such as rocket- propelled grenades, mortars, and bombs - making their arsenals potentially more deadly.
"In the absence of a governing force in Iraq, some Iraqis are looking to increase their personal weapons caches in order to protect themselves from looters and roving armed gangs; others want small arms to conduct illegal activities and gain political power. Reports have surfaced that gun merchants have set up shop on the streets of Baghdad, selling AK-47s for as little as $10."

So I'm supposed to believe that handguns are useful in battling tyranny but not having numerous amounts of the above weapons? Shows how inconsistent people can be when it serves their agenda.
