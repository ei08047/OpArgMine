Oh, well I'm not saying that companies won't be paying more money in health insurance. My point is that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really change company policy. The company's policy is currently based on the government's definition of marriage. If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married, the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs, and it may see more of its employees decide to become married. As it sees these things happening, it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit. What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person. There is no mandate sent out to the company, there is no change in company policy, and there is no payment that the company is dishing out. If as more married people show up in the workplace, the company decides to change its health care coverage, that is up to the company, but it is not mandated to make any change.
Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate, but I'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances. Regardless, I've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making. Quite a few companies already do it, in fact.
