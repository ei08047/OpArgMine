Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). 
There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that "UK will be Islamic", "Sharia Law for UK" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly "taking over" ).
"muslims are taking over the world" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!
