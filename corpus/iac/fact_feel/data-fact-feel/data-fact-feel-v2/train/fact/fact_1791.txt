Actually, there is. Well over 200 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly imaged by various means. All but Pluto have been found since 1992, and way over half have been found since 1998. I notice that of your references, one was published early in the year that the first (third if you count Pluto and Charon) was discovered, another was published two years later, and the third was published in 1974(!). MY GOD!! 1974! I also notice that none of them have anything to do with comet origin.
