My thought is, don't treat editorials as if they were sources of facts. I went to the CRU website, and their home page has a graphic showing definite warming over the time period in question.

Bob Carter, the guy who wrote your editorial, is either a fool or not above lying to make a point. The world is clearly getting hotter, all the data supports this. It's not like we're talking rocket science here. All this takes is reading a thermometer and writing down the results, which is a task that people have mastered for quite some time now. Anyone who tells you that we aren't heating up is either in denial, or in the pay of someone who doesn't want to be told to stop polluting.
