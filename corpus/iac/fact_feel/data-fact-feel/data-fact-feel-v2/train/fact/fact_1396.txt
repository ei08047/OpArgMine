Well, yes, but this begs the question of whether, even assuming epigenetic inheritance is real, all individuals would experience the same epigenetic alterations.
Now, I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance. But even if it were true it wouldn't do away with natural selection. Just as with basic genetic mutation, which isn't going to go away, one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to. This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.
Of course, if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment, i.e. are teleological in origin, then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs. Until they do, there is no reason to suppose there is any direction at all.
