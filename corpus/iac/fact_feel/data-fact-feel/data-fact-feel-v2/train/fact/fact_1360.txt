Where did Vitter lie ? He admitted his wrong doing and apologised to his wife. Had a liberal been accused he would have attacked the leak as a Right Wing attack designed to destroy him with the politics of personal destruction. The double standards are a joke. Out of 10,000 different names she has released, do you really think there are no Democrats on that list ? But ABC has those phone records so they can release a different Republican on the list every month to demonize the Right while never exposing the libs on the list, thereby creating a totally false impression of the real story that people from both sides of the aisle are guilty of indiscretions.
