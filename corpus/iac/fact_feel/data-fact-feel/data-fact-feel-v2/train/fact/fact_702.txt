The Supreme Court has declared that the Second Amendment isn't about hunting, so this argument is dead and moot.
I'd also suggest that you and this article author do a little research and get with the times. The AR-15 has officially been adopted as the hunting rifle of the 21st century. Remington now makes a version, the R-15, marketed exclusively toward hunters.
