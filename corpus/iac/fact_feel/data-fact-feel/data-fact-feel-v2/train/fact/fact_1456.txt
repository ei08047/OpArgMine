I offered a defintion that non-material is not made of material. He was entirely unsatisfied by this; assuming this adds to his belief that it doesn't exist
However
Material
The substance or substances out of which a thing is or can be made.

So, in fact the defintion for material is that it is made of material
So therefore, according to Mach, because that definition is of itself, it can't exist.
Of course he could say it's atoms etc., but that's what material makes up, not what makes up material
