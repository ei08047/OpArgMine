Actually, you are living off my organs and life processes. If my heart stopped beating, would you get fed? No. If my brain stopped? No. If I suffered a stroke? No. Two, the kidnapping is very synonymous: you were put in a life-threatening situation without consent, just as a fetus, doomed to be aborted, is put in one without consent. Three, these are arbitrary requisites and you have not proven to me why they are necessary to afford protections to the "entity." A man just knocked out in a boxing match shares many similar qualities as a fetus. Should we kill him? Four is nullified by two.
