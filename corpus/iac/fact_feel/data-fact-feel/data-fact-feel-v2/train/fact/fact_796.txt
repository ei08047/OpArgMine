perhaps we should read the first amendment again. Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion (and other stuff, but that's all that pertains to religion). It means it shouldn't single out a religion. It shouldn't teach something just because it's religious, but it also shouldn't not teach something just because it's religious. Making a law banning the teaching of abiogenesis and ID as hypothesies would violate the first amendment because the only reason we would be banning it would be because of the establishment of religion. And even if the first amendment does say what you seem to think it does, you think the solution is to violate the first amendment more to balance it?
