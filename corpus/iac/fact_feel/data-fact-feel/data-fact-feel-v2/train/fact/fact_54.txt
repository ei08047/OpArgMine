C.S.Lewis believes things on faith, yet we are to use his words, which he is not here to clarify, as evidence that my claim is false, when he obviously accepts the same illogical claim as premise? His use of the word accident can readily be replaced by "the natural laws of the universe", or other more descriptive terms, without the negative connotation that seems to scare believers. "We're an accident? OMG, then we must right!".
