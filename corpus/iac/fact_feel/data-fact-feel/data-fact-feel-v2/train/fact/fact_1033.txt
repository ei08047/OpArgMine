Indeed. Many people don't realize that the commandment is not "thou shalt not kill," but "thou shalt not murder." The important question then becomes, when is killing murder?
I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses. But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.
The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly. But the passage isn't talking about abortion at all. Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or isn't acceptable to take a life, and the passage doesn't provide guidance to that general question, either.
