Actually, the Second Amendment doesn't say anything about due process. It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons, but the right can be infringed with due process of law. In fact, the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed. One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation:
"If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.[185] Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House, or any other federal building...
The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not."
Chicago-Kent Law Review
18th Century Pennsylvania, which had its own RKBA, passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed. This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown. So why can't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists?
