I'm still having a hard time with this. 
If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? 
If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.
I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.
