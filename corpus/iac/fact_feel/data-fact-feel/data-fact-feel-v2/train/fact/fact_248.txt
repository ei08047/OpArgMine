First off, define "government funded". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. 
The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government.
