You're thinking is right on, sinjin.
Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one "goes further" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is “left behind” feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the “right thing” according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce.
