Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.
