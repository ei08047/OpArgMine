Nope. Yowm could be day (a in opposed to night - thus only around 12 hours or so), it could be a 24 hour day, it could be days (as in a lifetime), it could be just a general term for "time" or a "period". It could also mean year.
Yowm can be translated as each and every one of those. So your statement is false that it is "understood" to be that when it could just as easily be translated as one of the others.
