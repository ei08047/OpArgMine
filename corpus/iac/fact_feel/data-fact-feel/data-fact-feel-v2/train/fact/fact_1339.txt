Not between nonrandom variation and directed variation: between nonrandom amounts of variation, and directed variation.
For instance, if I heat up a kettle of water, the motion of the liquid becomes more violent. The amount of motion is non-random, linked as it is to the temperature of the water, but the motion itself is random.
Is that satisfactory?
Taking things a step further, we can also observe that the motion of the water, while random, is nevertheless constrained by the kettle. This is analogous to the 'developmental constraints' mentioned in the article you quote. I confess to seeing nothing problematic for the ToE in the idea that natural selection would favour genomes that are less susceptible to some mutations than to others.
