So, what you're saying is we shouldn't look at evidence and refine our methods and calculations when more accurate data allows for more accurate outcomes? We should just make a statement once, and stick to that, no matter what reality shows us?
As to your 10 billion year "gap" which turned out to be not a gap but a differece that came about by using different data sets to calculate the age, first of all, why is this a problem, second of all, have you heard of the WMAP project? It returned a highly accurate age for the universe.
