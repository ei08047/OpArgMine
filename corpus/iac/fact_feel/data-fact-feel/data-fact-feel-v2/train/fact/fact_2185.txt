Well, the people in Iraqu that we are killing are terrorists that just want to make chaos so they can come to power in the confution. We also went to war to remove Saadam from power. He killed 200,000 people. most of them were tortured to death. So yes it makes more sense to kill terrorists that are trying to kill as many people as possible than to kill little children that have not been born. Besides, babies are so cute :p
