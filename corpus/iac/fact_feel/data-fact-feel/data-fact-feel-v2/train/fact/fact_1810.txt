As I pointed out, you don't understand what either evolution or natural selection are. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies in inheritable characteristics in a population over generations. If the number of long haired animals became more frequent in the population, then evolution has occurred. Natural selection may (or may not) be the mechanism that caused the change.
