So again, this points to the fact that the appeals system is effective at preventing "innocent" people from being executed? I had asked for 5 examples of innocent people who were executed. Chemist99a stated that "we execute too many innocent people". Someone has yet to give me 5 examples of innocents that we have executed. 
And by the way: The information about the seven "potentially innocent" people that have been executed is quite laughable in some cases.
