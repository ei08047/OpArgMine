Okay, I won't say "preseservative," whatever the hell that is. (I can't say I'm impressed with what you think passes for literacy.) Fossils aren't bones; there are fossils of dinos and fossils of hominids, but not together. Plus, you can't refute multiple independent radioactive date correlations, millions of varves, millions of annual ice layers, plate tectonics, ferrimagnetic pattern reversals...
