actually, thats not logic, but its closely related. of course, if you stick your hand in fire it will get burned. logic dictates that the sum of initial energy must equal sum of final energy. etc etc
you are very right that logic is predictable and constant. this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god. a body of water cannot divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law. because gravity exists, its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible. there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity, so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already has
if, however, that body of water behaves in a way that logic cannot explain, then we can almost positively assume that such is the intervention of god. the only acts that can be accredited to god, in the bible, are those where something illogical occured
