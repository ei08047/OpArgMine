Because evolution is a scientific theory, and has evidence for it. Creationism is religion. ID is bad science, and bad theology.. and there is no evidence for. If you look at the people who push it, and the place where their funding is coming from, you can see it is a religious front for far right CHristians. 
Many Chrisitans do not have a problem with evolution. They are what are known as 'theistic Evolutionists', who feel that God directs the course of evolution. The intelligent ones of those realise that is a religious belief, not something that can be proven, hence it is an object of faith. 
Evolution can be demonstrated in the lab. It makes predictions that can be tested. And, with 150 years of testing, it has not been able to be falsified.
