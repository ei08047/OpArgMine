Rationalizing?
I guess so, since I'm trying to explain why it's silly for it to be illegal.
But, guess what, you are rationalizing why beer is legal.
And you're SO WRONG about drinking beer for 50 years. 
Drink enough beer to get a buzz and smoke enough pot to get a buzz every day and the beer drinker will be worse off.
But you and I both know that all this depends on the person.
If you want to limit it to a beer a day then I can limit it to one toke a day.
There you go...
If weed is good enough, one or two tokes is all you need.
You probably got WAY less tar than a cigarette and you didn't tax your liver with alcohol. (You also didn't tax your kidneys and GI tract with caffiene.)

Good lord, let's all go watch Reefer Madness everyone.
Please, explain how you "lost" these friends "to weed."
If your friend of a friend got his head blown off, that had everything to do with it being ILLEGAL...
But really dude, you're making this up anyway and it's silly.
