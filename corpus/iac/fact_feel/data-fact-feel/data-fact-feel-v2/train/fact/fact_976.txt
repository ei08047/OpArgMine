Such as what? It is not like putting two electrodes into the Earth and getting a measurement on some sort of gadget. The only way to measure how old something is, is by using a set of arbitrary assumptions. There are few things that you need to take into account, such as the rate of decay, and so on.
Creationists know that there is something seriously wrong with the radio-metric dating methods. Explain this then, carbon dating of wood under lava that was erupted from Rangitoto (an island volcano near Auckland, NZ) indicates that the erruption was around 200 years ago (the name is said to mean "Red Sky", suggesting that the Maoris, who have been their for 1000 years at the most, witnessed this event). Yet potassium-argon dating of the lava rock has given ages of up to half a million years old! Now this alone is a big flaw. Any person who uses their logic can tell that the result of the potassium-argon is way out, it should be less than 200 years. The radio-carbon date is only restricted to thousands of years, because even after several hundreds of thousands of years, there will be no more radio-carbon left.
The above came from Snelling, A., "Dating Dilemma: Fossil wood in "ancient" sandstone", Creation  21(3):39-41.
Creationists don't have (by their own admissions) all of the answers when it comes to radio-metric dating methods, but they can see enough that there is something seriously wrong with the underlying assumptions. Professor Richard Mauger says: "In general, dates in the "correct ball park" are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepencies fuly explained."
