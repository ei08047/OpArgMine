2.A small business in Richmond with eight employees will see a 23% increase. 
3.Insurance for a 40-year-old family with two kids in Indianapolis will pay 106% more 
4.Collection of payroll taxes for the new plan will begin Jan. 2010, but benefits don't start until 2014.
5. Payment to doctors for Medicare patients will decrease 21.5% next year and more after that. How many doctors do you think will continue to treat Medicare patients when that happens?
6. The plan will cost $871Billion over the next decate, but 98% of the cost occurs after 2014.
7. Medical device manufacturers pay $2Billion/year in taxes. This will rise to $3Billion/year in 2018, removing $1Billion that could be used for R&D and adding it to the cost of current devices instead.
8. The rest of the country will pay ALL of Nebraska's state contributions to Medicare FOREVER because that was the bribe that the Democrats made for the 60th vote.
