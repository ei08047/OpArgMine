We call that a strawman, here. You have much to learn. Let me explain. A militia is a group of armed, ordinary citizens who gather. There are all these "militias" running around screaming that they're a militia, but if my town was attacked for some reason, the citizens could just get some guns and gather on main street... to form a militia! Now do you understand? If so, I expect you to ignore me. If not, then you're hopeless. I can't get much clearer than that.
