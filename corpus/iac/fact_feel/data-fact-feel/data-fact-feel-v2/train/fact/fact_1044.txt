Neutral? One of the main standards and reference points for science and evolution on the internet is talkorigins.org. It's promoted as an educational site - a place with answers to criticisms of the evolutionary theory. It's every bit as biased as AnswersinGenesis, yet in many cases it's difficult for ID proponents to target. Part of the broad definition of evolution is microevolution, about the only segment of the broad term that is provable. They can masterfully employ that to make an ID proponent appear uninformed or irrational if he questions happenstance orignis, or other unproven evolutionary assumptions. They make their atheism clear in many ways however. They devote a page to comment about the "International Flat Earth Society", pretending they believe it to be a legitimate site. Almost any rational adult can see that it's phony. (Wikopedia calls it a hoax) There's nothing neutral, or even agnostic, about that site, and it appears to represent the anti-ID-in-schools mindset to a T. If there's actually a more neutral, agnostic, scientific website that opposes ID being taught in schools, I'd like to see it.
