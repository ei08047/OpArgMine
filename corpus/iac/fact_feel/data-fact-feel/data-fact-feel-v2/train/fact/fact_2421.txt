Species evolve because the sequence and organisation of genes evolves. It doesn't take a vast amount of genetic change to evolve one species from another, but it does take genetic change, and molecular geneticists are currently mapping the sort of changes needed to alter rates and timing of gene expression.
If you remove the genes from a cell that requires constant gene expression to function, it will cease to function. That's so obvious it doesn't need explicating. I do not see, hoever, how any of this can be used to make an anti-Darwinian case.
Biologists already know there's more to evolution than Darwinian natural selection, hells bells, even Darwin knew that! There is nothing in theory to prevent autoregulatory gene networks that control their own expression evolving by natural selection. If there is, somehow every biologists seems to have missed it.
