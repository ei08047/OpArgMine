Because bibliolaty doesn't equal Christianity. There are two issues here:
1) many may worship Christ through analysis of sources of his life and/or the inspiration of the holy spirit without believing all of the Bible is valid in any sense
2) many who do accept the totality of the Bible as meaningful are aware of the huge amount of metaphor, poetry etc. in it. Is everything to be seen as from God's point of view? Are the Psalms and Song of Solomon not powerful and illuminating human expressions of love and faith?
