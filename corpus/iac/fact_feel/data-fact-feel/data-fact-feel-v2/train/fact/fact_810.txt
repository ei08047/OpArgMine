Your argument, I believe. The one I said doesn't hold water. It appears to claim that the placing of restrictions upon items specifically designed for the killing of other human beings is somehow comparable to and a prelude for the banning of everyday items whose intended use is in no way connected to harm of others. Your title then equates this with a step towards a form of government in which one person is afforded executive, legislative and judiciary power over the country they control.
