First of all, it's not pro evo, it's pro evidence. But I guess that is kinda the same, as all the evidence points to evolution. Second, evolution's not a lie, it is supported by the evidence. Third evolution says nothing about god.
But alright, I'll make you a compromise, refute the list on this forum then. But remember, please use evidence in this refuting, not mere assertions.
