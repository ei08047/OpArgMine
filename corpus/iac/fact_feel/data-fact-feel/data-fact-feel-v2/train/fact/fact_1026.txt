Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States!
I don't see why we should care how many weapons couldn't be traced back to America even though they came across the border, because it's a moot point. The identifying marks don't exist on them if they can't be traced, meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy.
