Well some of ROCC's comments were addressing issues that lead to unplanned pregnancy. Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy, an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies, even when birth control is a factor. I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with, though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters. There are two main issues that have to be dealt with; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies, and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy. Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy. Desperate action cannot justify making morally objective issues legal, and i say morally objective since I'm sure any sane person will agree that taking away the life of an innocent person is morally objective. Governments could make a lot of money on taxing narcotics to people who wish to take use in them, though this does not justify legalizing narcotics. Desperate drug addicts will be lead to desperate situations of theft in which they even may morally object to, but must partake in in order to feed their drug addiction. Even in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics, they were just as safe as abortions are today, and haven't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics. These procedures, though underground, were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child, or just realize that there was a small demand to do so. (The actual statistic on the demand that were presented in Roe vs. Wade were fabricated by the pro-choice community ten times the actual value)
If you require me to prove or source any of this information, I would be glad to provide it.
