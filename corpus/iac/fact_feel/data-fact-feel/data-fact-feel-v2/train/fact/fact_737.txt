Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state. 
IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.
