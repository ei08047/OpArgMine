I did. You did not, and you did not read context. My response was based on the Chihuahua/Great Dane remark. Your source says they have the same basic set of genes. This is not the same as saying that all genes are the same.
You go on to say, "Their size and shape obviously have nothing to do with genetics," and imply that this is all phenotypic plasticity. Put your money where your mouth is, bub: Invest in a pedigreed Great Dane and a pedigreed Chihuahua. Breed them each to a pedigreed member of the same breed (i.e. GD × GD and Chihuahua × Chihuahuah, not inter-breed mating). Raise them in identical environments. According to you, all the offspring should have the same phenotype. Publish your results. You'll be rich.
Go ahead. It should only take a few months. Again, you'll be rich. What are you waiting for?
