Its odd that you would use that concept at all. Do you really think terms used to describe power structures in human organizations are applicable to cells and their subsystems? Genes are the heritable information store of cells, they perform their function, other subsystems perform other functions. The whole constitutes a living cell. The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept. What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems. A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy.
