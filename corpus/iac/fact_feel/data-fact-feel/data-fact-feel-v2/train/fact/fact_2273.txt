It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. 
The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. "Macro" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.
