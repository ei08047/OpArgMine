SO we are sticking with the now defamed "collective right theory" As of yet you have not explained:
How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments.
why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to "the people" in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd.
Ill keep it to 2 for now
