And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that 
destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.
I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.
