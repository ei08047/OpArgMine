But of course! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state. 
(No system can ever be truly closed, truly isolated from the rest of the universe, for what should be obvious reasons. Certain systems are only classified as 'closed' for experiments' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results, thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide.) In your pool-shot example below, for instance, the initial state must take account of the wear & tear of the table, the strength of the cue, the slope of the floor, humidity, temperature and every other variable.
So any such 'backtracking' (which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated. This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do, and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today.
