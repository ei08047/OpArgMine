2) Even if we accept the statement "Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance [about 543 - 525 million years ago]" (note the * ... wonder what that material says), it still doesn't address the appearance of the vast majority of species, or of higher taxa like genera and classes. Why are there no robins, eagles, vultures, chickens, emus, frogs, turtles, lizards, alligators, sharks, carp, perch, dolphins, whales, seals, foxes, rabbits, cats, dogs, deer, antelope, zebra, horses, kangaroos, elephants, bats, monkeys, chimps, humans, and so on in the Burgess Shale or other Cambrian strata? Evolution has a perfectly reasonable, and supported, explanation. But if God created all animals on "day x", then we should expect to find all types of animals - elephants & humans & mice, trilobites, and dinosaurs of all various sizes and mobilities, for example - all mixed in the same strata ... but we don't. (PS: And "flood sorting" doesn't resolve this problem with the religious, Creationist position).
3) The Cambrian "explosion" was not really a sudden explosion, but more of a extended event. A recent article (The Early Evolution of Animals, David J Bottjer, Scientific American, August 2005) describes a bilaterian - a bilaterally symmetrical animal - found in strata that is dated to between 580 million and 600 million years old. That's roughly 45 to 50 million years prior to the beginning of the Cambrian explosion. And the author adds ...
