That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. 
We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. 
This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.
IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.
