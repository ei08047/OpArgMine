Count me as one of those 14% since he hasn't demonstrated anything of the sort. And it isn't imposing our religion on anyone at all just because we rely on scriptural values in determining what is right and wrong in life. This is the greatest corruption of common sense that can be revealed regarding how the humanist thinks. 
What better way to erase scriptural based morality from the public debate than to assert that just by holding to a biblical value system in life is to impose ones religion on the atheist? This is the goal and defines the agenda of the atheist as it proves that at every level of public discourse it is their goal to claim that any spiritually based value system which opposes secular humanism, opposes the Constitution which couldn't be further from the original intent of the Constitution if it tried. The constitution was neither anti-bible or anti-christian. Nor was it anti-spiritual interpretation or application of the laws of the land which is evident by those very laws which exist and compliment spiritual values of christian americans throughout our history.
So your not very interesting opinion piece by these so called intellectuals fail on all counts as they must pervert and corrupt what has always been accepted values in this Country in order to reinterpret history if they hope to succeed in this application.
