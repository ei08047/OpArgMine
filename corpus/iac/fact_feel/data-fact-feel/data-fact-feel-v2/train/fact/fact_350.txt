Just like the first amendment starts with "Congress shall make no law", which is no less absolute. OR the fourth, "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated". Do I need to go on? Every one of the original ten amendments, witht he exception of the 6th and 7th contain strong language that leave no doubts as to the fact that the rights are protected. Yet we DO have laws regarding free speach, the DMCA, etc...
