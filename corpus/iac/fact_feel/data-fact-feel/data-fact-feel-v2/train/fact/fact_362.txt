Just to follow suit - note the bolded: What do you mean everyone knows who made everything. If that were true then there would be no religious differences throughout the world, no theological discussion, no theory of evolution, no need for this thread.
As for your assertion that evolution is random/accidental, you are, yet again, making a false statement (either through ignorance or deliberate falsehood). Mutation is random, natural selection done by waiting to see which mutation makes survival (and propagation) more likely. There will also be random events such as natural disasters, ice-ages, droughts etc which do introduce a bit of random luck into the equation, but that's about it.
If this thoughtful being created a harmonious existence, doesn't the extinction of umpteen species screw things up somewhat, or can your inexplicable harmony just carry on regardless.
