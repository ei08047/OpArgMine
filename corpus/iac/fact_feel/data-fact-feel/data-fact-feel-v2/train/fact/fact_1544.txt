Thank the lord you are not a creationist (pardon the pun). The method you referred to above is known as deductive reasoning, and is known to be a very valid way of finding a solution even by most 3rd graders. Also, I look at the Bible as a written record of what actually happened as well as the holy book. Seeing as scientists have believed the journals of young Native Americans from a hundred years ago, I don't see the problem of believing the written journal of hundreds of very wise men and women, including God himself.
