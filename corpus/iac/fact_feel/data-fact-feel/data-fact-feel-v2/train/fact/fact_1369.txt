I'm confused. Are you saying photo-sensitive bacteria aren't scientifically possible? Obviously, they evolved from bacteria without the ability to sense light. The mutation that allows a bacterium to sense light catches on with a generation, and natural selection takes hold. A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light. From there, it's a fairly obvious chain of events: photosensitivity becomes more efficient.
