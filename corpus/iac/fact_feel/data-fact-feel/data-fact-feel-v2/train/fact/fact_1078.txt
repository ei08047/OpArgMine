What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed "recent immigration," than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time, unless I misinterpreted it. But then again, I think it's possible that "micro-evolution" does happen in some birds such as finches.
