No it does not. God never attempted to provide proof anyway, aside from the testimony of a few witnesses. He leaves it to every person to decide for himself and believe in him or not. He requires that we believe in him without solid evidence based solely on the changed lives of those who do believe. Anyone who searches for indisputable evidence of Godâ€™s existence will not find it. There will be no physical evidence, no wonders, no miracles, no voice from the sky. You will only see God working in the lives of people or within your own life. That is the basis of faith. To believe what you cannot see.
