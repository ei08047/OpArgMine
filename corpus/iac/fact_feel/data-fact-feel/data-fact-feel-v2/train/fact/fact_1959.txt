There is nothing religious about babies.... 
They should be concerned with preventing the death of an innocent person... who made no mistakes, violated no laws, and whos only crime is existance.
if you dont think courts can protect babies, then do you.. deserve any protection?
If a baby can be killed simply because it is an inconvience... then why does it suddenly become a crime if the baby is 2 days old?
what difference is there between a child in the womb, and one which was just born?
its still the same baby.
The point is.. we can prevent all these reckless abortions, if... if... if.. we can convince all these wild loose sex acts... to be done with a condom...
Guys dont like condoms....
They must be made to recognise that they cannot simply walk away.
The only time, the girl will give the name... is when the guy made promises, and refuses to marry... refuses to care.. and the girl is left alone.
in those cases the bastards deserve to do hard labor, for atleast 3 months.
The state should promote... emoticonXLove
