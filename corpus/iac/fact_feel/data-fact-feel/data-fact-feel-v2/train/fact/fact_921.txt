Well, I am a philosophical naturalist and materialist. I don't believe the notion of free will. I think it's all a matter of physics and chemistry.
Be that as it may, whether I am right or wrong about the notion of free will, the consequences of evolution go beyond free will. They go well beyond what humans call good and evil, however we define those.
How about disease, predation, parasitism? Are they the product of an omnibenevolent god? That thought gave Darwin pause. Pain and suffering through natural causes yet through no fault of one's own? How is that a product of a just god?
There are aspects to real life -- some call them the problem of evil -- that are hard for Christians to explain, so many try to explain them away by creating the notion of "the Fall". Everything was perfect before "the Fall", and terrible afterwards. But that wasn't the way it was. The lion was never an herbivore. The lamb was never fearless of lions.
Pain, suffering and death have always been an integral part of life, and they always will be.Such benevolence. Such justice! And so potent is this toxic religious belief we feel we have to blame outselves for our trials! Or at least, religious believers feel they have to blame themselves.
As an atheist, I see the contradiction between reality and Christian faith. That is why I stopped being a Christian. My learning of evolution and these biological facts of life was a major ingredient in that. I accept that there are Christians who also accept evolution as an historical fact. I question whether they have thought either their faith or their science through.
