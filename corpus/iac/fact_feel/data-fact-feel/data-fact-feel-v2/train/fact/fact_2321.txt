Let's see if you will stand by this load of absolute garbage. 
My great, great, great grandfather dug a hole when he was 15. He put a time capsule in that hole. After years of erosion, I come across it at the same time a dead bug is found near it. According to you, they are both the same age since they were both found on top of the ground. 
Do you agree with this or do you disagree?
