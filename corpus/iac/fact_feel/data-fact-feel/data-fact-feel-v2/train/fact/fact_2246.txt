That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky. They way our justice system works is: 1) crime is commited 2) suspects are considered 3) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry.
In our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence. Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment. This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission. The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep. That is a very scary power given to police.
