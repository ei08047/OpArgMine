When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools, could it be that he "hardly knew the field, and didn't have an answer" that would fit the time constraints of his decision making? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago? 
Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first.
