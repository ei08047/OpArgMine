So you agree that we should leave weather out of it and focus on healt care cost?
All the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes i.e. longer life expectancy, fewer preventable deaths, lower infant mortality, in most cases more doctors per capita. They have lower cost in spite of the fact that the U.S. insurance companies insure only the healthy. Over there they treat the sick. What are the insuranc ecompanies doing with our money?? How come the small businesses, the self-emplyed are priced out of the market and left to die in pain??
