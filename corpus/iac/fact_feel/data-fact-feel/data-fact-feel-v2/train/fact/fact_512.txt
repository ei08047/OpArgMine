A fact is simply a phenomenon that is observable by any competent observer. It is not proven.
For example, Euclid made the assumption that one and only one straight line exists between two points. This is generally considered a fact. However, two points that cannot be connected by a straight line could be discovered tomorrow, and that Euclid's first postulate would be disproven.
