Try Islam. Even though many wars have been waged under the guise of Christianity, Jesus never preached that humans should force people to believe as we do. Muhammed, on the other hand, openly condones the spread of Islam by the sword.
Look at Mormons. I do not consider them Christian, though you may not make that distinction. They are the most tireless of all.
