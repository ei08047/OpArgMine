Well, you are talking to Mr. Statistics here so I am quite aware of how few abortions result from women who become pregnant following rape.... the numbers are not hard to find even from the sort of "official" unbiased sources many pro-lifers seem so quick to decry.
For example, first hit on Google.
Or if you have the patience to read it, this article.
Now we settled that, you are asserting it is fine to deny the women of South Dakota access to abortion if they are pregnant from a rape just because they are in a minority. I have problems with such an approach.
