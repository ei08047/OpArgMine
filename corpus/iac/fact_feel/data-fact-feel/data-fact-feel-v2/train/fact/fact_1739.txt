It's like the theory of the moon. We don't know how the moon was created. Captured asteroid, knocked off in a big collision, formed from dust at the same time earth did? We're not sure. But the fact that we aren't sure of the details of how the moon was created in no way casts any doubt on the existence of the moon.
We know evolution is a fact, that's certain. Some of the details we're still learning. Which forms of selection are the most important in what situation, enviromental factors influencing gene expression, the importance of cues picked up pre-nataly. These are all open questions. The fact that we have these questions in no way casts any doubts on the veracity of evolution, it just means that there's still more to learn. That's something that SS doesn't get. If answers don't come 100% complete and tied up with a pretty bow he wants nothing to do with them.
