Actually, it doesn't.
Perhaps you could try learning some new information rather than just making things up for other people to believe.
The concept of information, which you have chosen not to define for the transparent reason of employing a shifting definition, is not typically employed by biologists.
A mutation is what it is, regardless of whether you define what it contains as "information" or not.
Perhaps you'd like to get into insisting that information "requires a sender" now, we've all heard it before.
