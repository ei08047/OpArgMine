So know we are breaking it down to whether the loss of life is deliberate.
The restaurant bombing.
We thought Saddam was there. We KNEW civilians were there. We dropped four 2000lb bunker buster bombs on/around the restaurant. 
We KNEW that civilians would be killed. We knew that by pressing the button, the bomb would be dropped and people would die.
Compare that to the manufacturers. They make products that people use in their daily lifes. There isn't a button somewhere in the cigarette maker's office that kills a smoker when he decides it's time for them to die.
