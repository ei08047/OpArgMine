OMG. Here we go again.
Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. What theory of law would you use to support your point?
Hypothetical situation: Roe is overturned, returning control over abortion to the states. State "A" bans abortions; state "B" permits them under most circumstances.
1. What sanction does State "A" put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor?
2. How does state "A" prevent its citizens from traveling to state "B" to have the abortion performed?
3. How will state "A" determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state "B" to have the abortion performed?
4. Can state "A" punish one of its citizens for traveling to state "B" to have a legal act performed on her?
5. By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question?
After you finish those, Joel, I have a few more for you.emoticonXAngry
