What you are talking about is irreducible complexity; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal.
I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point. 
I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.
They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence, but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth, but it's also evidence for the earth spinning.
Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement "life forms are similar to other life forms", This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well.
Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology, direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation, it would have to be original useful DNA, or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination.
