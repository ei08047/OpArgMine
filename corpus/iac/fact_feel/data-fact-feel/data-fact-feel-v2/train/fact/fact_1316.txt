Okay.
The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular:
We make an observation about what we see.
We form a hypothesis based on our observation.
We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis.
We make an observation about what we see (in the experiment).
Rinse and repeat...
Now add a spur: after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses, a theory is devised.
