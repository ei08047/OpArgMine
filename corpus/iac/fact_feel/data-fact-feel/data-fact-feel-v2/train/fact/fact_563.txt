HeavenBound -- I would like to point out that Pandion clarified that you seem to oppose science. Because of the nature of your questions and how they are phrased, I think it is a reasonable assumption to make. However, I will come right out and ask you:
HeavenBound -- What is your opinion with regard to the evolution / creationism debate?
Peace,
The Bootfitter
