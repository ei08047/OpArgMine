The original statement didn't address anything about the difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human. It was a reasonable statement that suggested that no human being should be discriminated because of their place of residence. I asked whether you really disagreed with the statement, and you respond here with your opinion on the matter of a difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human and the semantics of the word 'reside.'
Your first opinion I can accept as your opinion, you are entitled to it.
Your second statement can be taken to mean that someone in a coma on life support is not 'residing' in the hospital room on the bed linked to life-support equipment, but rather that they are physically attached to it for their very survival. Or that an Eskimo is not 'residing' in an igloo in the Arctic with -60F temps and windchills of over 100F below zero... but that they are attached to that igloo for their very survival. (Granted, the igloo example is a bit of a stretch, but I just wanted to take an opportunity to say that I built an igloo in my backyard. It's pretty cool!)
