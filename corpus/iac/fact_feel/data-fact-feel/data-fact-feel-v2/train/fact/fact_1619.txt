I know that I've tried to make this argument before on another thread but Jesus was not God in that sence but the Son of God. God even says in the Bible that Jesus is his son so that they are apart of eachother but are not the same. Also, how do you know that a lot of the laws put into Leviticus were not just ones added by the chief priest? After all, the Bible was writen down by human hands.
Also I want to make reference to John 3: 16-17 (TEV* translation)
16: For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life.
17: For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.
*I specify the translation because it seems that most of the posters are using KJV, which kind of annoys me when I try to read it.
