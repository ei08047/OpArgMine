I think that while may be correct, it sounds too elitist to be accurate. Sane people don't create imaginary friends to explain things. Most tribal religions are very matter of fact. While exotic or fantastic they are very material (lots of talking animals), and also meant to be entertaining. They also incorporate superstitions, which often hold a few survival tips.
Also "primitive" religions revolve around hallucinations, via shamanism and drug use. I think no body asked why; they just got stoned and after they sobered up the human intellect kicks in an tries to reason if what happened was real then it must be some link to the supernatural. I know Judeo-Christian religions are anti drug use in most places, but in ancient times drugs was a very integral part of religion.
I have a soft spot in my heart for that "Jesus Raved" T-shirt.
