We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. 
I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead
