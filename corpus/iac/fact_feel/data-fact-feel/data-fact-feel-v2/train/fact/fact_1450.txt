There's nothing magical in the word "marriage." Just because one is called that doesn't mean it's any more legally superior than a "marriage substitute" (as you call it). 
Splenda may not be called "sugar", but at the end of the day (or should I say the morning) it still does just as good of a job sweetening the coffee. They're both sweetners. Why should we change the composition of sugar just so you can say the sweetner-composition YOU want is termed 'sugar?'
