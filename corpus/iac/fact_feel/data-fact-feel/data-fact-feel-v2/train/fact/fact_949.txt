"A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon.
"The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.
"In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'
"The News regrets the error."
