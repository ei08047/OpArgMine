Here is the first LIE and rewriting of history by a proponent of gay marriage. If anyone actually studies the civil rights movement they will plainly see that it was the southern democrats who plunged us first into the civil war under Lincoln's administration by attempting succession rather than freeing the slaves, and it was the DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS who fought civil rights legislation right up to the 60s before finally passing a weaker bill than was submitted by a Republican at the time. Al Gore Senior was one of the loudest opposers of civil rights. And was George Wallace and Governor Patterson, Governors who refused to honor or enforce equal rights after passage, Republicans or a Democrats? For you children from Rio Linda, they were Democrats. They fought desegregation at every level of the process.
