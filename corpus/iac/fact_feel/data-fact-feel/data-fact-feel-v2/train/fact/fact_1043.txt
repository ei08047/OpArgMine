Again, your argument doesn't make good sense. First you say a fetus has no chance against someone who wants to kill it. I agree with this. Then you say a child has a chance against someone who wants to kill it...and you base this on the killer's changing his mind because the baby's crying. Where DID you go to school? Haven't you heard of the many shaken-baby-syndrome deaths that occurred because some idiotic person in custody of the child got fed up with the baby's crying? It just wouldn't stop crying, so they killed it.
Until a child gets old enough, smart enough and strong enough to outrun or hide from someone trying to kil them, they have no chance of survival. Your argument is all wet.
We are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals. Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors. For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young, I can likely present an example where the males (sometimes the females) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition. A domestic bitch, when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups, will eat the weakling.
