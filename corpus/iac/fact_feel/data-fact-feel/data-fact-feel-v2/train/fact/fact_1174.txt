Which is true, [see above], but which is nothing to be ashamed of, since it applies to anyone, including myself, who feels motivated to debate philosophy. And although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science', they are not. They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity, i.e., ego, against the metaphysics of others, just like everybody else.
What is so very strange and unnatural, IMHO, about many materialist/mechanist/positivist/darwinist/atheists is that they will go to great lengths to deny that that is the worldview that their ego revolves around, and will always attempt to convince themselves and others that they are actually somebody else. Somebody utterly uninfluenced, psychologically, by any worldview, any metaphysic, any particular set of unconscious assumptions and prejudgements, at all. The rest of us are proud of the intellectual sub-strate upon which our opinions are based, be those opinions open to challenge or not. So why are materialist/mechanist/darwinists so often ashamed of being identified as such? Beats me.
