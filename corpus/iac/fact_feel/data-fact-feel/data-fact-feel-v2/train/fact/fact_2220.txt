As a matter of perspective on the above;
Roe is, was and always will be the historical reference for an example of "judicial activism."
Roe did not establish the "right to chose" if it had, the States could not regulate abortions at all.
The activists judges in Roe manufactured law in an attempt to balance the rights of a woman to her privacy against the States right to regulate abortion.
Doesn't anyone care about researching the facts before theygo running off at the mouth anymore?
Roe v. Wade - Oral Arguments
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, (later to become Chief Justice) dissenting.http://www.audiocasefiles.com/acf_cases/8960-roe-v-wade
"The Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the "compelling state interest" test. See Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. . . . (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the "compelling state interest test," the Court's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it.
