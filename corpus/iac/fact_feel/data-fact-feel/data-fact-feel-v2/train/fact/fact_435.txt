The major problem is that Sodini and others IDed as CCW holders are in fact not permit holders. The media is just as guilty as these pervert organizations. Either they are totally clueless about firearms laws or they are out to carry the water for the pro slavery express. In Soldini's case the closest he came to being a CCW holder was he purchased the pistols legally. He neither applied nor was granted a carry permit. The same was true of the Michigan case. We have no friends in the leftist media much to our detriment. Remember blood sells and the more of it the better it sells.
