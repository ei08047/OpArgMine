In this case in NYC, the law did exactly what it and most gun laws do best...PROTECT CRIMINALS. The Sullivan Act was passed for that purpose, to protect union thugs and criminals. How do you imagine laws such as this are "reasonable" or protect the innocent, law abiding people if they can;t defend themselves which is the first law of Nature!
Thanks for the admission that laws such as those do nothing for public safety and are a criminals' best friend and have no effect on Crime Control nor Criminals but punish and disarm those most needing such tools. Gun control is not crime control as your bunch likes to state. Situations like this are your worst enemy and destroy the lies told by the gun/rights grabbers.
