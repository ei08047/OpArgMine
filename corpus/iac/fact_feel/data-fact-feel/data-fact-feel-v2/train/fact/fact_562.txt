In fact, the period when theology was the "queen of the sciences" we generally refer to as the "dark ages." Science in the modern sense is only about 400 years old. You can get a hint of how the "queen of the sciences" operated by the fact that Copernicus (a priest) withheld publication of his heliocentric theory until he was quite certain that he was close to death; in fact, legend has it that he saw the first copy on the morning of his death. He knew what the consequences of his theory, that flew in the face of the geocentric dogma of the "queen of the sciences", would be. Giordano Bruno and Galileo both found out the consequences of stating theories that were in conflict with the "queen of the sciences." Only when science broke free of the domination by the Church were scientists free to follow the data to the conclusions rather than begin with the conclusions did real science develop and begin to develope real scientific theories. "Creation science" still begins with the conclusions and then tries to find data that will fit the dogma, even if it is sometimes contradictory. In "creation science" there is no hyopthesis, no prediction, and not test with the power to falsify the hypothesis. "Creation science" is pseudoscience.
