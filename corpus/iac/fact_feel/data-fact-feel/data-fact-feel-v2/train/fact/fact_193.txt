Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).
