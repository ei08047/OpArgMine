The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.
