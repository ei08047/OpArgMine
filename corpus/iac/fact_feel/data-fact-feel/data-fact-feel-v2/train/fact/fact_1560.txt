Actually NDS does not have to imagine the mechanism involved they actually know the mechanism. By the fact of their being alive (which is in fact the "life-struggle") they acquire (as a population) mutations. Some of those mutations aid them in their "life-struggle" and thus become more likely to appear in the succeeding generation. Thus the succeeding generations have a slightly different memory of the past than their predecessors. And thats that; the author clearly does not grasp the means by which complexity emerges in biological systems. Once more Adami is applicable here. And I have to add that the mechanisms of mutation, selection, and inheritance are well established at the molecular level, at the micro-cytological level, at the nuclear level, at the cellular level, at the organisimal level, and at the population and ecological levels. EAMs only riposte to that large empirical base is - to invoke mysterious and unknown and undemonstrated mechanisms which have no basis in fact. Sorry but the EAM hypothesis does not fly any better than a solid lead balloon.
