DNA that defined a biological system or function that did not exist in a organism before a mutation and benefits the creature significantly enough to change it's reproductive ratio.
The most common fallacy in defending evolution is that "nothing" in evolution requires a sudden or non-gradual change. Irreducible complexity proves this is incorrect, that gradual natural selection based mutations can only refine existing systems and cannot create new ones.
Examples exist on such simple life forms as bacteria.
