I think there are two separate questions here.
(1) When does personhood begin?
(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?
Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.
So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood
