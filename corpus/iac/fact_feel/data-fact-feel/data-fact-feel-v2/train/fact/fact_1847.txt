First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said "They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.
