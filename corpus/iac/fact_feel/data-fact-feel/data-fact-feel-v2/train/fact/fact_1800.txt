Actually, none of those are predictions that creationism makes, and what's more, they're all disprovable. Biochemists estimate we're within ten years of creating life from non life. Prepared to chew on that foot?
The logical leap you're making here is that if we assume creationism is true, evolution and abiogenesis must be false, and that's silly. It's actually possible for all three to be true. God could have the ability to create life, but perhaps God never did so and allowed life to arise through natural processes. Moreover, suppose God created the first life and allowed it to evolve from that. None of these possibilities are inherently contradictory to anything but a specific reading of a specific holy book.
