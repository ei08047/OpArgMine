Yes. Because evolution requires an old earth, supersport has lumped geology into the evil conspiracy. As our best explanations for the formation of the earth appeal to cosmology, that field as well as astronomy fall within the realm of quack science, according to supersport. In fact, every scientific discipline that has any connection whatsoever to evolution must be corrupt; obviously, chemistry is one of them (we can't make glycogen or DNA without magical, "atheistic" polymerization, right?).
