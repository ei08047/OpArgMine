Well the government track record in health care isn't too good. Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts. So if they can't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry? Medicaid is broke. The VA healthcare system is a shambles. You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare. Then there is the big problem of rationing. No matter what lies are told, health care is rationed in socialized medicine.
