Well let me tell you what Thomas Jefferson thinks of your pro gay sin folly:
"Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least." - Thomas Jefferson
Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments
Sodomy was outlawed in every state of the Union at one time. But now that homosexual sinners are coming out of their closets like the brazen hedonists that they are, we're regressing back to Sodom and Gomorrah values.
Americans reject gay marriage. It's a perversion and an abomination.
