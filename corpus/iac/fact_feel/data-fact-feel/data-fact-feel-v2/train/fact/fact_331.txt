As Mach pointed out, you (Montalban) are arguing with yourself here.
You stated that "bacteria needing nylon to survive" is put forth as evidence for evolution. Then you said that an alternate view was that there are some bacteria that need nylon to survive.
Anyway, an actual alternate view is that the experiments performed to determine whether the bacteria could survive on nylon alone could not have been exhaustive. There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives. It may even be similar to nylon, but it has yet to be discovered. This is a big maybe, though.
