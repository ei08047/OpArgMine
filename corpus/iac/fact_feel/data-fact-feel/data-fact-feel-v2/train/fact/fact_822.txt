Soooo lets see. You are denying a slippery slope exists. OK we have all of the gun laws you guys got during the Clinton Administration. 
1.The assault weapons ban. 
2.The ten round magazine,
3.institution of the waiting period, 
4.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, 
5.Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.
6.Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun. 
7.The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns, 
8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, 
9. Insta Check! 
10. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases.

and just recently the NICS improvement act!
But Yet, you want to add even more gun laws. But the Slippery Slope does not exist? Is that what you are saying? 
We have on this board alone, demands on our Constitution's Bill of Rights of total Gun Registration, Mandatory Storage with as of yet undefined penalties, a photo ID. Some advocate banning Assault Weapons, and you yourself have put forth several arguments that the 2nd amendment is not an Individual Right, and it applies only to a states right to form a militia. 
But the slippery slope does not exist!
