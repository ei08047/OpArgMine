Well, Satan was invented to explain why there is evil in the world.. the dualism. He was adopted by the Hebrews under the influence of Persia. However, in the Jewish religion, Satan is not this incredilbly evil being out to corrupt souls, but rather just an angel (who had no free will), whose job it was to provide for bad choices so that people may choose GOOD ,and thus live more sanctified lives by their own actions.
