Well, the easy answer is that a lizard didn't evolve an avian lung. There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung. However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.
So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.
However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.
But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.
Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say. To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself.
