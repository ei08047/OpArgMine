Because it's all quite clear. Decades of effort from the religious right, conservative republicans, and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic. It's a tragedy, but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you, everyone knows it, and no one is going to do it. It's politics 101. The democrats, as a whole, want to do the right thing, but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything. They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action. 
This is of course a generalization, but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable. Generally speaking dems don't trumpet gay rights because they know how many votes it'll cost them, and thus prevent them from actually working for gays rights. Reps don't trumpet gay right because they don't support gay rights. This is the common political wisdom, and if you want to show that it doesn't apply to a specific individual you need to make the case for that individual.
