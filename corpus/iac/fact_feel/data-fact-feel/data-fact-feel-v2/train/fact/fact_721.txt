Sure. I would like to discuss the first one. It shows obvious similarities that are almost certainly not coincidencial.
In part I, the fish and salamander look similar to everything else (note the curvature and the small flaps under the head).
However, in parts II and III, the fish and salamander begin to look different.
You can see where this is leading, right? It is leading to the assertion that these organisms are related, but that the fish and reptiles are not as closely related to the mammals as the mammals are related to each other.
This assertion is also backed up by the fossil record, but that isn't as visible as this picture.
