Yes, that's what he is saying. It seems that in your small, closeted little world of ignorance you aren't aware that a Roman Catholic would never refer to a priest as a preacher. Miller was talking about the ministers of the non-Eucharistic protestant sects, like yours, that rely more on words than deeds.
However, original sin is a basic tenet of Catholicism. Your failure to know that is yet another sign of your ignorance. In fact, the source of your concept of original sin is Roman Catholicism, probably through several other invented religions.
