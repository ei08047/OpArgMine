Actually, that's not true. The standard upon which the "super accurate atomic clocks" are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth. It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently. I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time. It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting.
That's what is happening with the "leap seconds" that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year.
