Actually you could look at this issue in several different ways.Lets start with welfare.Lets say the mother of a newborn who is responsible to finacially and physically take care of her child gets on state aid and agrees to not take child support from the father if he chooses to *opt out*Okay thats fine and dandy but if you think the goverment is going to support HIS child bucause he chooses not to ,well HAHAHA YOU HAD BETTER THINK AGAIN! Anyways things will NOT be equal until a man can actually carry and give birth to a child.Comparring the right to choose abortion and the right to choose not to pay support are completely two different issue that are not comparable.A women has to risk her possible life long health to either choose pregnancy/birth OR abortion a man does NOT risk either in his choice to support or not.This issue doesn't even touch on abortion for rape/incest or health reasons of the mother and or fetus.emoticonXDonno seems to me a deadbeat dad is using the pro-choice position to get out of paying support when HIS body isn't even in the issue.
