If someone gets busted for providing a firearm to a criminal there is already Serious jail time, regardless of what you say you want. It is totally irrelevant what you or I want. Totally irrelevant. In fact no one is even asking us. 
We have a whole Federal Department dedicated to gun crimes and criminals. I can understand that you, and apparently people like the Illegal Mayors headed by Bloomberg might think they are not doing the job up to your standards, but Bloomie and his bunch was asked to cease and deist because they were ruining Federal and local investigations. The way I see it, is, you want special privileges with your law.
