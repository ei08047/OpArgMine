Actually energy can be caused by matter. Newton's Theory of Gravitation shows that gravity is an effect of the presence of mass. The presence of a second mass within the gravitation field of the first mass gives the matter gravitational potential energy, which, without an opposite force to balance it, is converted into kinetic energy.
