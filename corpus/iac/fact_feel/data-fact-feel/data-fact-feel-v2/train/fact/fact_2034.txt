Well the 'brain slip' seems to be permanent and deeply embedded. I have been waiting for someone to call the three million population statistic and point out the Republic has over 300 million inhabitants not counting illegal aliens and terrorist not known.
Actually the "gun crazies" you mention are comprised of folks who harbor the same sentiments you do :) You fail to see the right to KBA about to be recognized in Heller and applied through the States by incorporation in McDonald. Being Constitutional will mean you will have to change or to move. Be aware that the Nations who ban guns for the common people are the ones making the news about mass shootings and cartel murders. You fail to note that governments killed far more of it's citizens in the last century than all the wars combined. Picking out anacronisms to garner support for whatever cause you support is so weak it is not a blip on the radar screen and could be easily solved by adherence to the Constitution. Just like you overlook the population to find a few abberations, you mistake the act and suggest this man was a law abiding citizen and an NRA member. Evidently your interest lagged and you didn't read his pedigree nor his past criminal history. A 'gun crazy' misses all of that in their haste to point fingers meanwhile overlooking the myriad of gun laws studied by CDC and the NAS found no benefit of any of them but here you are beating the drum calling for more of the same innefective nonsense and avoiding your responsibility to protect yourself, family and property and a third person as well. You completely shun the fact that the police have NO DUTY to protect you nor anyone else. Now that is not only 'gun crazy' but pure, unadultrated loon behavior. You might ought to read Gun Crazy BY Jacob Sulman I believe? You have all the tics of being a mental case who hasn't been certified yet.
