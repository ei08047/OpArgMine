Where am I getting with this? The bill that would allow the Attorney General to deny a firearms purchase to anyone and everyone if their name is on the secret suspected terrorist watch list. The list with an unknown criteria for getting on, no disclosure so you know even if you are on it, and absolutely no way to get off of it.
And what are these mayors saying? That a person who gets denied a firearms purchase -because their name is on this secret list and the AG has the power and authority to deny you said purchase- needs to be prosecuted as if they're a criminal.
