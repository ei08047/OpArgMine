I'm not going to even mention how perilous common sense is. I'm confused by your statements about all animals having brains and consiousness. Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms, like sponges and jellyfish, do not require a centralized nervous system. Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma. You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some, making your assertion meaningless. Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche, and this would be caused by slow natural selection, not by holy edict. By the way, most pastors I'm familiar with would tell you animals don't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought. As to you stating God gave animals the ability to change to their environment, do you have evidence of massive bodily changes? Tell your assertion to the millions upon millions of species that have gone extint in Earth's history because of changing enviroments or more powerful competition.
