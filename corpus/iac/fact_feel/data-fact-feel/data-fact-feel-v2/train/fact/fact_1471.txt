Halton Arp is far from suppressed.
Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.
And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.
I'd say that if he is "suppressed" then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his "fireworks" universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this. 
But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these "weird" redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time.
