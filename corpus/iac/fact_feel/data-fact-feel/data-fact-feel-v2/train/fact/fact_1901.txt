Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.
There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them.
