Also keep in mind that some changes can happen quickly if you select for a quality that's already present in the population. Something like beak size will following a bell curve. Most beaks close to average size, some larger than average, some smaller. If pressures change so that those with below average beak size gain some advantage than they can exploit it instantly. From the word go they will be eating better and be more healthy than their big beaked cousins, and so more likely to breed successfully come next breeding season. And if the little beakers are the most successful breeders than we would expect to see alot of little beaks in the next generation. Basically, the genetic variety is already present in the population, so exploiting that variety can happen quickly.
