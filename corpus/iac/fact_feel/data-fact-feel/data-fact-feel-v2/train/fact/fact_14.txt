Well, that was badly stated. But we've been over this before and you still don't seem to grasp. No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil. However, given the nature of life that we do observe, where we can see many species of equus, 36 species of cat, 28 species of canid, 8 or 10 species of bear (with as many more extinct species), 850,000 species of beetle, and on and on, we conclude that life was similar in the past. And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics, we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds. But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics, just like there are many animals with cat-like features. Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion. So we don't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism. But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact, is is believed to have eventually gone extinct (in all three known species). What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds. Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics, at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds (but we can't determine which one or ones that might be).
And we haven't even gotten into the question of derived morphology. Why don't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl? In fact, why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are, in fact, artiodactyls?
