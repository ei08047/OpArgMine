"As President Calderón and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war," President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month. He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America. (In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States. And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico's government.) "We're going to be very focused on this. It's going to be a top priority." ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama "felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a[s] it affects their safety.”
You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90% figure, Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it. Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they don't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico. 
Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either can't or won't get control of their criminals.
