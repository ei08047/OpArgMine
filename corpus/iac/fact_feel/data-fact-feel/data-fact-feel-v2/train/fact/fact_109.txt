Typical YEC misrepresentation. Professor Olsen has no qualms with the concept of evolution- what he does not see is the link between birds and certain theropods. If you think he does not think evolution is correct I suggest you send him an email asking for his views. Here is his address:

Off course, you might be trying to infer that because their are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant. I disagree, but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within, lets see......... how about Christianity? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable?
