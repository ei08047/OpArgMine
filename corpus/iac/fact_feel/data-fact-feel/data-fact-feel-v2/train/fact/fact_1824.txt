The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.
