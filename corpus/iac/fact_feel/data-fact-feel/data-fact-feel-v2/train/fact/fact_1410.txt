Yes it is. It will be funded by government money, the taxpayer will foot the bill.
The argument that it will not be "subsidised" is based on the ridiculous hypothesis that somehow, someway, it will turn a profit and pay back the enormous injection of public funds needed to start it up (of course, providing an interest-fee-unlimited-repayment-term-loan is in itself, also a subsidy).
If it behaves in such a way as to maximise profit, like its private sector alternatives, what possible purpose does it serve? It's either 
a) Pointless. Why don't we also have a "public option" pizza restaurant chain and a "public option" door to door sales force?
or 
b) Very bad.
With about a 99.999% probabilty of b)
