Actually, the Miller-Urey experiment is basically so simple that with only a little training in the lab you could do it yourself. Please show that you are not a dupe and specify what you mean by "organic matter". The experiment was intended to show that in a reducing atmosphere with a source of energy, amino acids can form spontaneously. Several similar experiments have been done since that have shown that the formation of amino acids is almost certain. For example, they have been found in meteors.
But that was a long time ago. More recent work has demonstrated the spontaneous formation of lipid membranes, reproducing molecules. The information is available to anyone who takes the time to educate himself.
