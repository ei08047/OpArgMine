Ah, yes, a return to the redefinition of '(un)natural'. Fair enough - it's using the Bible to support a viewpoint, but that's kinda what creationism is I guess.
From the 'scientific' creationist view, the challenge would be to then prove that humans have never undergone 'micro'evolution. Especially given the various mutations and differences in humans today - from minor differences like height and hair colour to more major differences like minor variations in bone structure (often racial differences) to the most extreme differences like varying number of appendages (see the 'two-toed' tribes).
But you're right - I guess that the traditional response would be 'the bible says this, so reality must be wrong...'
