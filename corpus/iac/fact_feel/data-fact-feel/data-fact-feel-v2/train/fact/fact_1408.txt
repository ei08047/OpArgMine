I see myself as just as capable of swinging from being responsibile, safe and trustworthy into irresponsible, dangerous and untrustworthy. I believe every humans possess the ability to to do so, but not nessesarily through the involvement of firearms.
Although i must reiterate the words "responsibility, dangerous and trustworthy" are entire being of a subjective, circumstantial situation.
