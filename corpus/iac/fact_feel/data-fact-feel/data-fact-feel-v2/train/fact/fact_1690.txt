Yes, we have already established that abortionfacts.com is a pro-life page and as such is far from impartial. You talk about "increased risk of cancer, increased risk of hemmoraging from botched abortions, depression, suicide, post-abortion trauma syndrome" but these are measured against women who are not pregnant. While an abortion (like any medical proceedure) carries risks, these are far smaller than those posed by a woman who sees a pregnancy to term and gives birth.
In case you forgot, here are the figures I quoted you before:
http://www.acog.org/from_home/public...v103n4p729.pdf
Which shows an abortion will cause 0.3 deaths per 100,000 carried out in the USA in 1995.
http://www.childinfo.org/eddb/mat_mortal/
Which shows a term pregnancy poses a 1 in 4085 risk of death over a womans lifetime in industrialised nations in 1995.
You do the math- how many abortions does a woman need to have before she is as at much risk as that posed by taking pregnacies to term over her lifetime? Something like 80, which gives a good indication of the relative risk......
