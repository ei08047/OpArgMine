There's much more to it than that. There are several different kinds of genetic changes that are called mutations. Evolution is not limited to the effects of point mutations alone. Why don't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by defining a point mutation, and then name and define several other kinds of mutation.
And, of course, there are other mechanisms that increase the genetic variability in any population besides mutation. On the other hand, there are mechanisms that tend to reduce the variability in a population in addition to natural selection. Please name and explain at least 4 others in order that you do not continue to look like a fool.
