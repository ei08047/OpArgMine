So it's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US? That's kind of hard to believe. NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there. So I don't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out. You may be confusing cause and effect. You wouldn't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals don't help people get better.
That website starts off with the rumor that there are over 20,000 gun laws. Although this claim has been repeated numerous times by anti gun-control activists, has anybody been able to verify this claim? A recent study that counted the number of gun laws found "only 300 relevant federal and state laws regarding the manufacture, design, sale, purchase, or possession of guns."

Another reason not to put too must trust in biased websites that cherry pick the facts.
