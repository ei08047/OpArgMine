But if the Bible is the Word of God, then it is the truth, is it not? Hence, this would be far more reliable than man-made methods. You interestingly enough bring up the so-called "scientific dating methods". Well, did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply, only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory. Since you have some education in paleontology I trust that you know that most fossils do not usually contain radioactive minerals, so they cannot usually be dated by radiometric means. What is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer, and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating. Now, there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed.
In the "Creation Magazine" there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in "250-million-year-old" sandstone, or in volcanic rock "tens of millions of years old" has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years. Now you should know that if the wood was really 250 million years old there would be no radio-carbon isotopes in the wood. Radio-carbon dating only gives dates limited to a few thousand years according to evolutionary theory. So now comes the question, which one are you going to trust? This example came from: Snelling, A., "Radioactive dating in conflict!", Creation 20(1):24-27, 1998. Also when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times, sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs, such as Oxford, the "dating" almost invariably gives results in the millions of years! This came from: Snelling, A., "Radioactive Dating Failure", Creation 22(1):18-21, 2000. This strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed. Now creationists don't have all the answers when it comes to radio-active dating, but they know that there is something wrong with it, examplified by the examples above.
