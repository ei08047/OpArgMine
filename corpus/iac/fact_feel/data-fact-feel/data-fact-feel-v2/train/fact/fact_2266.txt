New York mayor Bloomberg broke the law by sending undercover agents on sting operations outside of his state of jurisdiction to get the evidence necessary to sue 19 out of state licensed firearms dealers. What he did was illegal, and the ATF threatened to tear him a new one if he didn't stop it.
Bloomberg broke the law for his own personal crusade. Are you happy about that?
Or are you going to take the chicken way out and claim that a public official must be allowed to break the law to address crime in his territory?
