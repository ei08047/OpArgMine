Well, that's not quite right. Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena, not an enumeration of them. So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate, say, the power of prayer. 
Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically': what is it that defines something as being material? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle, yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world. Why? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method: assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested. If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology, it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those, too, and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural' than clouds or rainbows.
When you get your head around that, it's immediately apparent that it isn't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that aren't scientific, it's the methodology people have for dealing with them. Indeed, when the scientific method is applied and doesn't yield the results believers in such matters want, the typical response is to come up with excuses why we shouldn't expect the scientific method to work. Unfortunately you can't have it both ways; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code.
Really, none of this would be a problem if science didn't have a (from a religious perspective) nasty habit of finding explanations for, or hidden and unexpected complexities within, features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements. Because despite the fact that you, SS, and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality, the actual bone of contention is always in the material world. So who's really treading on whose toes here? It's your choice to shackle your spirituality to a particular - and demonstrably wrong - version of material events, SS, not mine.
