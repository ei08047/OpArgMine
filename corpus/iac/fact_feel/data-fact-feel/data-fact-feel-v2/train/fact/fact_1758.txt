So you’re saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE? 
The ToE is supposed to be defined as changes in alleles, not changes in anything someone wishes to assign it to. It seems that in addition to the term evolution being broadened to mean just about any change, it is also substituted for the word “science” at will. Notice how it was done in post #2 above. The word “evolution” was dropped, and the word “science” replaced it. 
What are the possibilities that evolution is “brought in as a narrative gloss” after a discovery, rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology, or all of science?
