1) the theories and laws constantly change, so it's not like there's one standard that's benn kept to. At best the 'theories and laws of science' are statements that fit with as many experiences and events as possible
2) If someone reports something against science, it's rejected as 'unscientific'
3) I'm rejecting the certainty of experience, so using experience to prove it is circular
