Thanks for posting the other side of the story jyoshu. It helps to give a much more balanced look at what happened that night. Here's a link to Mathis discussing the making of the movie, the process they utilized and how they didn't quote the scientists interviewed out of context at all. The scientists even got the questions they would ask in advance when requested.
