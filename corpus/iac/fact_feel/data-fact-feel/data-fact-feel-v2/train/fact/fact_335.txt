Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful. 
HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the "lots more". 
Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)
When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.
As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.
I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next.
