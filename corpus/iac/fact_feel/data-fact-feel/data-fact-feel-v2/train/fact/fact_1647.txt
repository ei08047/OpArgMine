Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't "on the grounds," although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).
Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:
McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)
Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)
McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that "accommodating" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not.
