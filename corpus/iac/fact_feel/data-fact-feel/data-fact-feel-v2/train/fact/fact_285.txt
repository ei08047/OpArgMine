BWWWWAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Are you trying to be deceptive or is it that you really didn't understand what you read? It's really pretty simple. The first link does not suggest that man arose in China. It is a discussion of a primate fossil. While humans are primates, all primates are not necessarily humans. The article discusses a primate fossil, the oldest yet discovered. It does not claim that mankind arose in China.
Your second link leads to a discussion of well known human fossils from the middle pleistocene or later. None of them are as old at the Australopithecine fossils of Africa. Maybe you didn't read you own links, but I don't see any claim of the origin of mankind in China. The claim is that early hominids (Homo erectus) migrated to China from Africa. The oldest H. erectus fossils are found in Africa and it would therefore seem that that is the origin of the species.
