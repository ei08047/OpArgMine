You have ignored a third option, my denier of all that is right and good. That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider, and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares. 
What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive. It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you, that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it. It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible, yet it defines the way your minds work. emoticonXDonno
