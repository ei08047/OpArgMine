Sadly, you may be correct. The mindless majority of the American people have been duped to believe that science is somehow opposed to their religion. They know that the mythology of bronze age nomads is historically correct. Don't confuse them with facts - so what if grasshoppers don't have 4 legs, what if rabbits don't chew cud, and who cares it bats are not birds? The Bible is true without error.
Certainly people who have bee indoctrinated to believe that "GODDIDIT" will believe that question. They have been taught that it is a sin to question revealed truth, and revealed truth is revealed by "ministers" who are scientifically illiterate.
Why does creationism seem to be a matter of the views of those who are becoming rich from the stupidity of the Christins masses.
In the mean time, the U.S. is now a second rate country, where our universities are manned by an increasing number of foreign professors. I don't have a problem with foreign professors except that there are no qualified U.S. citizens out there. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the leadership of U.S. universities is due to the influx of foreign professors. They get paid more here than in their own country, and of course, they are more qualified than U.S. applicants for their positions.
I wonder if our universities will be able to maintain leadership in the world of academia when the entire upper echelon is overtaken by better educated and more qualified foreigners.
In fact: Japan has about half the population of the U.S. and graduates about twice the number of students with degrees in science and engineering.
Isn't it wonderful that we are debating the pseudoscience of creationism and ID in our school boards? It is the beginning of the end.
