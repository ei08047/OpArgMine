Religious faith, by definition, is a "jump in the dark" and there is really little
(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and Scientific
Materialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there is
nothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. But
someone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see 
this.
The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life 
can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,
aesthetic sensibility and such like.
