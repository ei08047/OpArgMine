As I said the gene was from its inception a theoretical construct developed to explain certain observations on pea plant characteristics. A convenience in describing how the traits were observed to be inherited. Its never been hard linked to any specific molecular architecture except for the short period of the one-gene one-enzyme (or protein) hypothesis. The concept grows more and more complex at the molecular level, but it also remains viable as a means of describing and studying the heritable elements underlying phenotypic traits at the conceptual level. Thats a tribute to the initial mental feat of Mendel in coming up with the original concept!
By the way there are no points or lines or squares or circles etc. Geometry must be dead don't ya think?
