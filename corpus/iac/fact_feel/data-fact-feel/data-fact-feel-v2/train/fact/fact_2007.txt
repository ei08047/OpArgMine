Oh, I don't know... he could be on to something. Of course, applying his and Kurtz's logic to other situations could explain some other modern day mysteries. For example:
From Colson's article:
For thirty years I have been going into prisons across America. It has been a wonderful opportunity to share Christ, but it has also been depressing to watch the prison population explode at the same time: When I left prison thirty years ago, there were 239,000 inmatesâ€”now there are 2.3 million in America.
Clearly, his 30 years of visiting prisons has caused the explosion in the prison population. Maybe is was all the Bible thumping...
Ahem.
