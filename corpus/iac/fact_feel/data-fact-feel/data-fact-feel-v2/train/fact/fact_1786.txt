Actually, no they could not find oil without evolution. It's not only a matter of finding "certain rocks" associated with oil, but by reconstructing the paleo-environment. Only certain environments, indicated by types of rocks and the types of animals/plants that existed at that time, are suitable for the production of petroleum.
In fact, a lot of mineral resources are located by certain geologic formations as interpreted by modern theories of geology. Without a knowledge of biological and geological evolution prospectors would waste a lot of time looking in the wrong places.
