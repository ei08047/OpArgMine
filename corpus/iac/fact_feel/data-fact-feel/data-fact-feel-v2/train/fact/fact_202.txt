So sex is only a privelage for those who can phisically give birth? Abortion is not Black and White as you are trying to paint it to be. It's much more complicated. Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby.
