No! 
At conception we are a person and human.
All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.
A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.
The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.
The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.
