We accept plasticity, but we do not accept that plasticity can account for what has been attributed to mutations and natural selection. It has only been observed to change minor phenotypes (shell thickness, type of bee).
By the way, you have contended before that plasticity can cause a fish to change in response to predators (which benefits the fish). Now, you are trying to say that life doesn't evolve or change in any beneficial way.
