Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.
