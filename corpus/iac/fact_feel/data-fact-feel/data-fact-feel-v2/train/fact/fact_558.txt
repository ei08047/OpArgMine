A) we can use experiments to show evoution. We have observed it. For example, there is the lactose test, where some bacterial had the gene
to digest lactose removed. After letting it grow into the billions, and
then fed ONLY lactose, it can be shown that some individuals had a gene
that could digest lactose, and survive. There is also anti-bodic resistant
bacteria that evolved due to the use of antibodics .. evolution at work.
