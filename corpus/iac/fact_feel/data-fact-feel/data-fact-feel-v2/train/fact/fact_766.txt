Oh goody. Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking, no research and even less actual thought. Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi). Yes, it is flightless because it has no need to fly. There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird. It swims and eats fish. It's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by "flying" through the water like a penguin. Like the penguin it is a diving bird.
