I think that you should check with cosmologists, astrophysicists, astronomers and the like to see why most scientists accept the findings of those sciences, even evolutionists. I suggest you read some books.
The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report by Timothy Ferris, emeritus professsor at UC Berkeley. A really good writer, Ferris has taught courses in journalism and science writing, as well as english, philosophy, and astronomy - a total of 5 diciplines at 4 universities.
Other books that may help you to understand the topic are:
Wrinkles in Time by George Smoot and Keay Davidson. The book is a report on the COBE experiments that verified the predicted unevenness of the background radiation. A good explanation of cosmology in general.
The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene. These books require some scientific savy, so they may be a bit too difficult for you.
