Because Matthew, society has to take the time to define its standards. We don't start with the assumption that anything-goes; standards are developed over time. Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry. Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage, and this is all a part of simply determining (over time) where those limits fall.
Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process, so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening. In fact, even with civil rights itself, it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It happened earlier than that with women's suffrage. Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent. Some things have become rights, some haven't. It's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards. The problem is that some in your movement seem to want to circumvent that process.
