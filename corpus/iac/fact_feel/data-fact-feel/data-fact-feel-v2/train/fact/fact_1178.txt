Not at all true. They secrete mucous, they do not melt.
As for the absence of some verses form various versions/editions of the bible - I have had that problem too, and not just with quotes form "infidels." For example, many versions have 're-interpreted' or re-translated' various verses to reflect certain political views and ideologies (which I find disgusting). For example, I have heard of a version that now singles out "abortionists" as evil-doers, and I have had a hard time tracking down online bibles that contain the actual KJV of Luke 14:26 - many have removed the word "hate" and replaced with a more conservatively correct "love less", which is not even what the original Greek was...
So, not being able to find certain verses does not mean that they are made-up or otherwise inaccurate, it may be that various versions have altered/omitted some of them...
