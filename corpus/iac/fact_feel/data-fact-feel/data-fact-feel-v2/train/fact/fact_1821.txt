See Sarge's post about Ted Kennedy being listed. What did he do that would make him get on the terrorist watch list?
And what about the four year old boy who was denied flight because his name was also on the watch list? Because his name was the alias of a known terrorist.
What answers do you have to address these points?
We've had plenty of people claiming that being on the no fly list, or the suspected terrorist watch list, should be all the criteria necessary for denying a person the right to buy a gun. And now we have the mayors claiming that failing the background check -even if it's because the Attorney General is abusing his power- should be grounds for criminal prosecution.
That's not liberty. That's not justice. That's not freedom. That's not American values. That's completely unacceptable, and goes on the show the character of those who support gun control. Secret police and secret courts to be used against the American people will not be tolerated!
