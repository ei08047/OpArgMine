Actually, there is no such implication. However, there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor. For one thing, we might expect that the molecule of heredity would be the same across all life. We find that it is DNA. We would expect that the particular codons that encode amino acids would be quite similar for all forms of life. That turns out to be the case, except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life, the DNA code is identical across life. We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do. We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat, which are carnivores, which are mammals, which are tetrapods, which are vertebrates, which are chordates. We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals, and we do. We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth. We find whales with feet. We find reptiles that are very much like mammals, even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals. We even find mammals that lay eggs.
