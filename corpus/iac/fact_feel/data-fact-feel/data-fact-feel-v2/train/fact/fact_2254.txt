Are you referring to the Epicurians? Aristotle? I can't think of any reference to these people as atheists. Socrates was accused of being an atheist, and the accusation made it clear this was because he didn't believe in the gods. Some schools of Hinduism have been atheistic from BC, and Buddhism (founded before 400 BC) is essentially atheistic, in that there are 'gods' but they are considered limited and not given much importance.
More generally, I think modern atheists and fundamentalists are both largely the result of 
1) the breakdown in everyone conforming to one religion, probably starting at the Reformation
2) the scientific outlook making people mistake religious meaning for scientific meaning, causing them to either think the Bible must be scientifically true because it's religiously meaningful, or that it must be religiously meaningless because it's scientifically false. Richard Dawkins and the average creationist make the same fundamental mistake - the greeks would say they mistook 'muthos' (myth, allegory) for 'logos' (reason, science)
