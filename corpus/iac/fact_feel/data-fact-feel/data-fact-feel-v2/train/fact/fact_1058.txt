Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." 
This doesn't mean they don't have them.
Same thing with animals. 
The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. 
But the book never says "animals don't have souls."
So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).
