But, of course, this is true of any test question in any science class. No test question in science ever asks for an opinion. They all ask for answers that confirm a knowledge of the science. The law is meant to intimidate teachers. But if a student expresses a religious opinion on a biology test, that opinion is actually irrelevant. The only consideration in grading the test is whether or not the correct answer was provided. The student may also give an answer based on religious mythology, but as long as the correct answer is given, the student passes. However, if a student answers all questions in a class of earth science or life science with religious mythology, that student fails. He/she isn't being penalized because he/she expressed his/her religious mythology, he/she is being penalized because he/she didn't answer the question correctly. Students are not asked to express opinions, religious or otherwise, on tests of knowledge of science. They are required to confirm that they have a grasp of the science.
