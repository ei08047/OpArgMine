And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?
