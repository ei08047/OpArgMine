Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of "organic". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however.
