Yes. We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof! But science doesn't try to answer that question. We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago. What went before that and the cause for the expansion isn't known and at present, and may never be knowable. However, we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing, for no apparent reason. Google "Casimir effect" and read about one example. Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry. This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum.
