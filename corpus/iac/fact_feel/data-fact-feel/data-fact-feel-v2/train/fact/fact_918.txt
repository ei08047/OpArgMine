in defense of the fruit fly, why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment? what good does a 7th leg do?
and about the experiment itself - please, ALWAYS post references. who did the experiment? when? under what conditions? how? assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that?
and im sorry, but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution, you just need to go and look at it.
