How elegant. Yes science is the way to understanding the physical world, and faith is the manifestation of our spiritual selves. But when you say this among sci-only people, it is immediately misconstrued. Most sci people won't even read that sentence objectively. Say the word "spirit" and suddenly you are changed into a fundamentalist, inbred, uneducated, dimwit who wouldn't know Planck's constant if it hit you in the head.
Life is much more than a series of reactions. It is cool that we are able to reduce it down so much. The benefits of science are vast. But there just seems that there is more than meets the eye. I'm curious.
