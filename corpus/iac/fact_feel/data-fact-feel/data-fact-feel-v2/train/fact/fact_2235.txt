Completely wrong. One CAN prove a negative by showing that it is self contradictory (ie a square circle). Also, proving a positive claim WRONG is not the same as proving a negative claim correct. In that sense, theories most definitely CAN be proven wrong, as Creationism has. The predictions which Creationism makes were false. It was dismissed a long time ago.
