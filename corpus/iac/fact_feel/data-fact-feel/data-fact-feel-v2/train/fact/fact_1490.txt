I believe Jesus actually can be both. Jesus called himself "the son of man", and we all fall into that category. Jesus calmed his father was in heaven. Jesus asked his mother, "Who is my brother or my sister?" 
How can Jesus be the son of man and yet the son of God? What prayer did Jesus give when asked?
Jesus told those who asked for a prayer from him to pray; "Our Father, who art in heaven." Hold up- If we pray, "our father", then who are we?
We are the son of man. We are the son of God. Maybe getting to know yourself brings you closer to God than anyone else can. What does being born again mean? All things born have a mother and a father. 
I believe love is logical. And Love is the simple key to understanding yourself and your neighbor. No other key will get you closer to self understanding. Now its logical to say a designer places a little of himself in everything he makes. If this is true then God is in us. Maybe love and a mirror is the best book you'll ever read on the subject of God.
