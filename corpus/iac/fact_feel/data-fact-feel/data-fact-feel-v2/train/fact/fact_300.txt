Because homosexuals aren't attracted to members of the opposite sex, so it's pointless. In order to have a right, you have to have a legimimate way in which you can exercize that equal right. That's not possible with hetero-only marriages. There is no special right, it's equalizing it for biological concerns. 
Saying homosexuals can get married, but only to heterosexuals is like saying that they HAVE the right, but they have to go against their biological/mental state in order to exercize that. That's unreasonable. Of course, prior to this debate, Blacks COULD get married, but only proper marriage was between members of the same race. emoticonXRolleyes They have the same, equal rights!
