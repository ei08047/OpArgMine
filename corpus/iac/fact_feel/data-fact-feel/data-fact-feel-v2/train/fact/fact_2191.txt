The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term "flat earthers" - ridicule without substance. It's much more recent however. It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson, a young college graduate with a degree in physics. He wrote it as a joke, as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools. That web page is a long one, with all the little pictures & everything. It probably started more simply than that, and grew after it became the cult hit that it did. It got attention on many other websites, and in the press as well. The Washington Post reprinted it word for word, and a New York Times headline read "But is there intelligent spaghetti out there?" With that kind of publicity for a view that desperately gropes for talking points, it's not surprising that it comes up in many debates here. We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared? :) Both terms, "flat earthers" and "spaghetti monster" seem to come up much more often than "happenstance origins", or even "Darwinism", a 150 year old concept that's troubled by several recent discoveries. Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument, and you haven't touched it. Can you?
