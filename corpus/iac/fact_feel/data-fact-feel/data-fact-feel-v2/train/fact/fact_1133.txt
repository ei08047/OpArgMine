the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god. since logic exists, god is not needed.
i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist? why? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase. this would occur with or without god's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true. logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god's presmce either. the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained, the less god is needed. 
god and logic are indirectly proportionate. an increase in logic causes a decrease in god
