Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.
I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.
These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.
Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.
