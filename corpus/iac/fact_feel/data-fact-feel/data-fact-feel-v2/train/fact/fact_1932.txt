Surely the theory of evolution cannot predict whether a species is extinct or not!
I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage.
If the coelacanth's habitat was no condusive to change then the same would apply.
