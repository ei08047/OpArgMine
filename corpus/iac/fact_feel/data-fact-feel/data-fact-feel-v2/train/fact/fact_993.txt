And so am I...
Dear rapture -- With all due respect, I would encourage you to formulate a clear thought and communicate it in a way that an average joe like me will be able to understand. As your two posts are written, I have no clue what you are attempting to communicate. I do have some interest in the topic of viability though, so if you could perhaps explain what you are saying, I would be interested in discussing the topic with you.
Thanks!
