Yes, of course the past can never be proven.
But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.
We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.
* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)
