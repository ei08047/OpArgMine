If there’s no proof that it’s genetic, then how can one say, with any degree of certainty, that it isn’t a matter of choice? The professor attempts to discredit choice by stating there's no proof it is and promote genetics even without any scientific basis to do so. His selective use of "lack of proof" as his main criteria is dubious as a result. 
Some make the claim that nobody would “choose” to be gay because of all of the psychological baggage that comes with it. The teasing from straights, the parental pressure, etc., but we know that rebellious teens will do a lot of anti-social things by choice, so that argument doesn’t fly.
