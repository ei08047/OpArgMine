The way it works in Kansas, the state board of education sets the guidelines and sends them out to all the school districts where they sit in a box in a closet somewhere. During much of the time when all this idiocy was going on, I was ON the local school board and had never once opened one of those books. We all knew they existed, and nearly half of us knew where ours were, it was just not something that anybody generally cares to look at. I would be shocked if you could find me 10 kids in the entire state who have ever read the state school boards definition of "science" or their guidelines. It is just not something that comes up. 
IMO, that is why this issue came up in kansas. Our state school board here has VERY little power or control, so nobody really pays attention to them. When the first set of changes occured, there was a lag of about 6 months before anybody even realized it and then it was somebody from the media.
