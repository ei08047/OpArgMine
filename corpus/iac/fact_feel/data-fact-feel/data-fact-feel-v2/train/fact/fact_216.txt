peddler, how about you actually address the points I put to you originally?
"Off course, you might be trying to infer that because there are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant. I disagree, but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within, lets see......... how about Christianity? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable?"
Cheers :)
