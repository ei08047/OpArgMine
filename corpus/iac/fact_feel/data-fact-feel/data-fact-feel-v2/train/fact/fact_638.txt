did you miss this quote in the article????
 Clanking like ceramic, all of these bones were fossilized
All I have to say is you guys are hilarious. First you say humans have never been found near dinosaurs...then when I show you otherwise you just make up excuses!
So how do you explain the soft tissue, flexible, red tissue found in t-rex bones?

Fossils Yield 10-Million-Year-Old Bone Marrow -- A First
http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ssil-bone.html
Fossilized bone marrow has been discovered in ten-million-year-old frogs and salamanders from an ancient lake bed in Spain, scientists announced Friday. 
The specimens are the first examples of fossilized bone marrow ever to be discovered. They are so well preserved that the original color of the tissue is still visible. 
"The marrow is organically preserved," McNamara said. "The original color of the marrow is preserved.
Like modern frogs, she says, the bones show an inner zone of yellow, fatty marrow, encircled by an outer zone of red marrow."

this is a pretty good trick for a creature that is over a third of a billion years old! And by the way...don't let the words "fossilized" fool you...fossilization/petrification can happen very rapidly....as shown here:
