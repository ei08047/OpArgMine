So you see, Brady, you're wrong again. The McDonald ruling wasn't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups. Quite the opposite. The McDonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason. It was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything.
