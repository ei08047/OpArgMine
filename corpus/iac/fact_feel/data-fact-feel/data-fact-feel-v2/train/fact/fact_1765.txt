Any geologists want to help me out here?
What they mean by this is that there are sediments in one place and sediments in another place. They can date them radiometrically to determine that they are both from the Edicarian period (even though they may be seperated by millions of years). They then verify that they are Edicarian by looking at the layering to determine if the two pieces were at one point connected, but are now seperated due to tectonics.
I'm sure I'm not entirely correct about these methods.
I think I'd better study up on some of these qeustions HERE.
Maybe you should too.
