Doesn't matter? If you're still on your straw man, whatever, if you are referring to an individual pharmacists not servicing based ON religion (Which is the case in many instances), then it's in black and white as against the law.
Regarding firing, if it's not in the press or if it's good/neutral press sure, some minority groups don't get equal treatment under the law, that's nothing new to America. Yet if it's national bad press that builds up, no, businesses distance themsleves from such nonsnese. They have on gay rights/health benefits, they will on drugs. Their business is to serve customers, not to promote religious mumbo jumbo. A few companies may indeed choose to not carry, who cares, that's your straw man. I'm talking about individual pharmacists in the large chains (wal mart, grocery stores, etc.) making a choice based on discrimination, refusal to service an individual.
