Will it be 100% legal for you to carry a gun?
If the answer is yes. Then so what? So what if people react with panic? If you are 100% legal, then it is your right to carry a gun. Your rights are just as important as thiers.
I was once reported by a woman at a gas station for carrying a gun. I was not carrying concealed. I was very professionally dressed and driving a very yuppie car. When the cops came by, I was not the one the cops were XXXXXX at.
BTW before the cops arrived I had removed the pistol from my hip and placed it in the glove box.
