Right on! A real man supports those he loves, through thick and thin. He doesn't try and control the things he can't either.
In the end, it's not a man's decision. It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men.
