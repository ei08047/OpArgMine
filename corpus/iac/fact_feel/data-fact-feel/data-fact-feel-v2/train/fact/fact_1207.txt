We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.
I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it.
