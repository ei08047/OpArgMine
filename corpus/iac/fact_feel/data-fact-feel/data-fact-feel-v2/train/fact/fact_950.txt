Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. 
So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?
EDIT: that seems dramatic...not "fire" them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed.
