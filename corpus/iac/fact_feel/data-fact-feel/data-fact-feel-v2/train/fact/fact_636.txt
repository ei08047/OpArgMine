Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born. 
And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.
