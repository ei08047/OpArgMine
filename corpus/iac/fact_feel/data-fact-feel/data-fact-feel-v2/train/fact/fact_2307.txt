So you don't have genes in your body that aren't activated? Aka my father has blue eyes and my mother brown eyes. I have 1 blue eye gene in my body yet I don't have 1 blue eye and 1 brown eye. But 2 brown eyes. So it's obviously not active.(ok bad example) Don't know the exact name for it. But don't rabbits have a genetic response hard coded. As every animal. That when they are being chased that they make irratic maneuvres. He says that the chickens had genes that had some hardcoded information about how to respond to certain conditions. They got activated in them. And the same information was passed to the children. 
So they don't come out all big eyed and is mister big teeth my uncle?
