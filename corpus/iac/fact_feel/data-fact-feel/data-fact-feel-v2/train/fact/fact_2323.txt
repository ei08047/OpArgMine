This is a much poorer analogy than mine could possibly be. If drunk driving were legal and didn't affect anyone outside the driver's body it could be analogous. If drunk driving did not affect anyone outside the driver's body, I would agree that they probably should have the freedom to do so if they so choose (even if I personally disagreed). However, the reason drunk driving is illegal is that it endangers everyone on the road around the driver.
