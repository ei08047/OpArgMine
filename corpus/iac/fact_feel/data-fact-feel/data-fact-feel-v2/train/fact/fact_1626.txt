The points individually have already been answered but actually you will find out that there is no complete proof for anything. No one can really tell you a definite answer to these questions.
No one can be completely sure what happened, but at least Evolution gives more information and "proof" that makes sense.
How could you prove me that your opinions are right? Can you prove me that the Bible is correct and definitely the infallible word of God? You probably can't, because no one can.
Everything is just a theory, Evolution just as Creation...
So please do not ask questions where you know that people most likely can't give you a definite answer (because no one knows it) just to finally say that if Evolutionists can't prove it completely it most likely isn't true... We all know that ourselves...
There are no real answers to any of your questions... (yet)...
