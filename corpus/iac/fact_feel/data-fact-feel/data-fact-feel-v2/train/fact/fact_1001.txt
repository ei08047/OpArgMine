Wait on, we are confusing our history here.
Catholic Church was a branch of The Church, along with the then Byzantine Orthodox domonination.
The Great Schism was between the Roman Catholic Church of the Papacy and the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine Empire. It took place in 1054 when the then Pope excommunicated the Byzantine Emperor from the Church (who, not to be out done responded with his own excommunication of the Pope).
They might of patched it up had it not been for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade initiated by Pope Innocent II. Oooops!
The Protestant Church was formed by Henry VIII when he declared himself head of the Church in England in 1534 in place of the Pope by the Act of Supremacy, so he could divorce and marry as nescessary. He never did get a fit male heir though.....
