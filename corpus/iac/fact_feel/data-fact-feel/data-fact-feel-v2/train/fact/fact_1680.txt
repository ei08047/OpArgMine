While that definition of sin is true, the Hebrew definition means missing the mark. You could stretch it to mean unfit in English.
And you're technically wrong about the bible. Modernly it is one book, but bible means little books. For a time they were floating around in clusters. So academically they are self contained and unrelated. The apocryphal books are "secret" books. Religious scholars eventually decided they were just a bunch of stories, and most never made it in the bible. Look at Song of Solomon it made the cut, and people still have problems with it being put in, yet it conflicts with nothing.
