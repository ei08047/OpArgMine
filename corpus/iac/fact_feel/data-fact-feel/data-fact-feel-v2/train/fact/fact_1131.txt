You have not proven any lies....Sorry, you have not.
The studies were done in different countries.
AND, since the APA is now also reporting the lack of
genetic evidence, obviously there are no lies involved.
ARe you aware that in May of this year, (you should catch up) the APA has begun changing the language in their papers, related to therapies,
causes of homosexuality?
These are professionals, belonging
to the APA, including their former presidents and leaders...Sorry but you
are wrong, the paper includes studies from different countries
on twins, the facts are it is an "environmental" cause not a 
genetic cause......that is what the studies are showing and even
the APA is beginning to change it their writing suggesting reparative
therapies will work, depending on the cause...
