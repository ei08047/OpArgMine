Police are probably much more aggressive than the average citizen, but most of the time their aggression is channeled against the bad guys. 
And don't you find it significant that a gun, a symbol and tool of violence, can raise levels of testosterone? What kind of effect does testosterone have on behavior? Dogs become more friendly when testosterone is reduced in their bodies through neutering: 
"One of the most important behavioral advantages of castration is that as adults, these dogs will tend to be less aggressive both toward other male dogs and also people. The androgen (male) hormones, of which testosterone is the most important, are responsible for the development of many behavioral patterns. When young puppies are sexually mounting their 7 and 8-week old litter mates this is because of androgen surges in their bodies. The same is true with aggressive behavior."
