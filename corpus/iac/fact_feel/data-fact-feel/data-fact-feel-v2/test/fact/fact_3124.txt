Again, how so? If you can grip a tree with a birds foot and climb it while your preadator can't would be a great advantage. Likewise, a predator who can climb trees and get at the food sources up there would have a advantage over your competition.
Ostriches and other flightless birds seem to get along just fine with their feet. Why would you say they were suffering from a detriment?
