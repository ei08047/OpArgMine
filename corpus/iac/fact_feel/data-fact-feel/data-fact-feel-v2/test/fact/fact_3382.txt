of course he says "might", science always tentative. any time you see something along the lines of "it happened this way" there is always an implied, but unseen "probably" between the "it" and the "happened".
Look... you made a comment about how Dawkin's observation that the eye is flawed is actually support ID because it actually justifies a creationist's argument that it's ok to look for well designed aspects. I responded by putting your accusation in context (He was criticizing Paley, and he never actually used this as evidence, just showing that it could go both ways). 
Now you go off on a tangent about how dawkins’ logic is flawed, and how behe's logic is accurate... i don't want to get into that because, both dawkins’ and behe's make much better arguments themselves (anyone reading, go out and get these books… behe is much more technical and raises some questions that must be answered, however makes (imo) some unwarranted conclusions at the end of his book. Dawkins is much less technical, however provides logical reasoning as to why evolution is possible and how it works)
but i do want to point out that while this is an example of 2 different interpretations (good/bad designs in the eye) given the same thing, it is NOT used as any kind of scientific proof of anything. opinions are not objective scientific evidence because they are subjective.
