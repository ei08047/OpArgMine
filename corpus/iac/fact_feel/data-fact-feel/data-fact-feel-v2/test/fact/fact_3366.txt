Ditto! With that in mind...
I want to let you make your own arguments for your position before I post a rebuttal to any of them, for reasons described above. Instead, though, I can post a brief few arguments of my own.
Firstly: the statement you are trying to support is "Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception". However, the word 'life' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning, does not have an absolute biological definition. To quote the wikipedia article on it: "It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms". This is doubly the case when considering the 'life' of an individual, as opposed to the 'life' of, say, a skin cell. For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.
The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?
Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?
Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?
