WOW, and you claim to be a teacher? No matter our kids have the lowest scores in the World. Didn't you know that it was the democratic south that started the civil war to fight against the abolition of slavery? And didn't you know that it was the democratic party that fought hardest against the 1964 civil rights act? Until Johnson finally submitted a watered down bill compared to the Republican bill due to political and public pressure?
