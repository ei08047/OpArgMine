And where does the 'Theory of Evolution' say that Man came from monkeys?
That is a very inaccurate statement. Perhaps you do not accept evolution because of lack of information? 
What the theory of evolution states is that monkeys and apes came from a common ancestor, and that humans are apes from a taxonomy point of view.
While there are 'gaps' in knowledge, I suspect if you did a study about what we actually do know about evolution, and human evolution in specific, you would be amazed at what we DO know.
