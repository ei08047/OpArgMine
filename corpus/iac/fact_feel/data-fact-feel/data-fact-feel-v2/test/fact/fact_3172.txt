Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.
Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?
