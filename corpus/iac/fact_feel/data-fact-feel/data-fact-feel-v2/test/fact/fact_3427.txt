How do we get a tree to stand upright long enough for it to petrify, and how do we get upright petrified trees in layers of strata.
There is evidence all over the world that stands up for biblical events, all you need to do is open yourself up and have a look..
I urge you guys to get a hold of the movie "The search for the real Mt Sianai". This movie is rivetted with evidence for the Moses account in the bible. Any person with there head screwed on right will not be able to deny it!
