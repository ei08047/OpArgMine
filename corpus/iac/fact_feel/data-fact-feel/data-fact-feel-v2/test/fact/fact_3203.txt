Same evidence, different interpretations based on different starting faiths.
We will use the Lucy type skeleton and the next supposed evolutionary progression Homo Hablis (for short hand, HH). CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals, which determine balance and locomotion, are more like those of baboons than those of humans. This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.
Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model. This is just an example of what they may do with some fossils, IMVHO.
