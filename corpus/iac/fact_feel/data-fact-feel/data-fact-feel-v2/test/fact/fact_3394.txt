Well you seem to be going against what your theory says....here's an overview: (please notice there is no mention of epigenetics, nonrandom mutations, the inheritance of acquired characteristics, adaptive mutations, or horizontal gene transfer -- all of which can bring about new traits/functions.

How Organisms Evolve
Evolution occurs on populations, not individuals. Individuals do not evolve, but are part of populations which do
Evolution is a genetic change occuring in a population of organisms over many generations 
Population Genetics - branch of biology that deals with the frequency, distribution and inheritance of alleles (genes) in a population
A gene pool is the sum of all the genes occuring in a population
 The Mechanisms of Evolution
There are five majore causes of evolutionary change within a population
1. mutation
2. migration
3. small population
4. nonrandom mating
5. natural selectionGenetic Drift - small populations are more effected by random chance 
Your theory is OUTDATED!
