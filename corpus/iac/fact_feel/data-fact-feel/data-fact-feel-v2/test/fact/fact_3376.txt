Actually it isn't. No, really, it isn't; I'm not making this up; I think you've genuinely crossed a wire somewhere there.
Traits are partially described by genes; they're the starting point - as you once put it, the 'hard drive' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically, thermally etc etc. That's one reason frogs need so damn many genes while placental animals can get away with a lot fewer: frogspawn have to tolerate such widely varying temperatures during development and need proteins that work correctly at all those temperatures, whereas mammalian foetuses develop in a chemically and thermally regulated environment.
Weismann's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse. The genes provide the starting point, the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism, but there's no feedback. Retroviruses might constitute a hole in that barrier, which opens up some interesting possibilities.
Anyway, the point is, the ToE as it stands does not say, in any shape or form, that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in. What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development, it can't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype. The environment can only have an indirect 'say' in the genotype of organisms, by allowing some to flourish and inhibiting the success of others.
That's why, in the other thread where we're discussing the butterflies, I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do: the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons (based on chemical or thermal variation) and Natural Selection, in this case, is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better. Simmer for a couple of million years and... well, there you go.
