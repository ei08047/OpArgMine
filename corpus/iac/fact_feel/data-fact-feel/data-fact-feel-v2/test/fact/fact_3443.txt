They affect you too.
I must quote again...
"The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution."
Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) "Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction", p12.
I have been at pains to quote this, not because their work is in the field of epistemology (for when I post evidence, from epistemological sources, I get the reaction I just got from you; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists!' These evolutionists recognise the variety of influences, not all affecting us all on a conscious level. You simply ignore this evidence and present a statement that you don't believe it.
Further I find it odd people should demand that I cease quoting from outside sources to back up my statements.
