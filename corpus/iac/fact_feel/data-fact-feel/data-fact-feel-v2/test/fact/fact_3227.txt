I spoke no lies.
I can substantiate my position WITH POLLS that actually ask the people leaving WHY they are leaving.
Rather than listen to that, Archie would have us listen to people who are ENTRENCHED in REPEATING the very reasons why people are leaving Christianity...
Such glaring misrepresentation of reality is obviously an act of a dinosaur complaining as it sinks into the tar pit.
A logical person can very well ask "If the reason people leave Christianity is because the religion is not adhering to biblical principles, then WHY do we STILL HAVE MOST CHRISTIANS thinking homosexuality is a sin?"
Cause you see, changes like the above with the Lutherans DO NOT come about because most people WANT the church to be more strict...
They come about because there are MORE people in the church who WANT the change.
