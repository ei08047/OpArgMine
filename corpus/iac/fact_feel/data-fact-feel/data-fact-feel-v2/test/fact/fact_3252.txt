Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you can’t blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist) – you’re not going to find much about biology there.
