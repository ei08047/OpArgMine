Yes. That is one component of evolutionary thought. But there is more to it than that. Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static (as far as the fossil record reveals) for long periods of time, sometimes millions of years. Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly, in a flash of geological time, maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years. Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population. Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them. They agreed with Darwin. Finally, in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin, Dobzhansky, and Mayr. I think their paper, in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events, was published in 1972.
