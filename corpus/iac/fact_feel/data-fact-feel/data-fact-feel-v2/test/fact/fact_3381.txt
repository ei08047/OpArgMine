You couldn't make an association like this to save your life. Hitler gained power by deception much like what is happening now. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (google it) puts to rest any claim you have made about Hitler. He did disarm Jews, Gypsies and others he was afraid of because they did not support him. He also had some weird features you share like torturing and burning helpless creatures! People cannot be tyrannical by definition. Check it out! Your claim is dismissed for want of cause and no true stated claim.
