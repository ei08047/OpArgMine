Ok, so are you saying that nucleotides aren't individually selectable? Is that it?
Well, actually, they are. No, I'm not saying that they are passed down separately or anything. Please don't write your rebuttal before reading this post.
What I'm saying is that one nucleotide can make a difference in whether an organism survives or does not survive. For example, let's consider penguins and the Galapagos. Now, it is a well known fact that the Galapagos were formed relatively recently. Before then, it is generally accepted that penguins were in Antarctica only. In Antarctica, penguins had plenty of feathers, enough to die when they progressed to the tropics. However, penguins also had variation in their feathers, so when a current brought them to the Galapagos, they quickly started to evolve. The few nucleotides that controlled feather thickness made a large difference to the survival of the penguins. In this case, they were important enough to make a difference easily. The DNA was inherited as a single unit, but some single units had single parts that made a difference.
