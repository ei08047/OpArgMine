Is this not illegal?
Both federal and state laws prohibit businesses from denying public accommodation to citizens on the basis of race, color, religion or national original. The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to "full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin."  
If the reason a pharmacy kook is refusing service based on their belief that doing so is contrary to their religious beliefs (or that they are supporting a behavior that is considered bad in their religion), then is it not clearly illegal?
The grey area is of course if they lie and say it's not religion, it's just "ethics", or "whim". In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)
Up to the courts I suppose. Personally I would feel discriminated against, and "morality" is easily linked to religion (especially in these cases). If I were discriminated against on religious grounds I'd feel I have a pretty good case (not necessarily a good chance of winning in this christian/ignorant nation).
