Again, you are mistaken. ALL of these groups compete for multiple things, and I'll give you real, concrete examples you might even be able to find watching Animal Planet.
1.) Animals compete for mates ALL THE TIME. Have you never seen male lions fighting each other, or elk, hyenas, etc, etc? They fight, the stronger one wins, and the female selects the victor to be her mate, and they produce offspring that likely would grow up to be stronger than those produced by the other male.
2.) Animals compete for resources ALL THE TIME. Nature moves in cycles. Regions experience dry periods, wet periods, cold periods, hot periods, etc. Therefore, viable sources for food fluctuate from season to season. At one point, for example, there may be more predators than prey. With not enough food to go around for entire populations of predators, only those with the ability to go long periods of time without food, or can more effectively find food before other individuals in the population, will survive and those that cannot will likely die. When you get into animals that live in groups (packs, herds, etc.) you will find that competition occurs between these groups. (I am reminded of a famous scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey)
That's really all I have to offer to this debate, hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points, seeing as I'm hardly the expert. supersport, I have been watching your posting strategy, and frankly you seem to be shooting yourself in the foot; most of the things you claim as "facts" are downright false. I genuinely want to hear where you get such claims, but I fear you'll just ignore me like you ignore everybody else who makes a point. Please, address my points. If not, you can expect a PM from me. I just want to know where you get this stuff.
