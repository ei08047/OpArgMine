Evidence isn't peer reviewed.(*-see correction below)
Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what's peer reviewed.
And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't "proven" anything. 
The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.
Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered. 
The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.
There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians.
