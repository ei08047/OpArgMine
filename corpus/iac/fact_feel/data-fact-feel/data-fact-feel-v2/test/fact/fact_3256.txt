Actually, you are misreprenting the scienctific answer in the following manner
1) It is not evolutionists, it is astrophysicists.. 
2) It is based on testable observations.. 
3) Based on the available data, it is about 13.5 billion years old.
4) It does not address the issue of 'Why we are here' at all. 
5) It is not based on faith, but based on data. If data comes into change that evalutation, then by all means, it will be changed. This has happened a
few times when it comes to cosmology. Our technology is good enough about gathering information it would probably take a real major discovery to change 
things drastically at this point (but that would be fun)
Although you claim that religion can do the same thing, that can not be demonstrated. You are also making the false claim that people who are religious can not accept science.. the only that that is different is that they don't take the stories in the bible literallyi, but only as an allegory.
