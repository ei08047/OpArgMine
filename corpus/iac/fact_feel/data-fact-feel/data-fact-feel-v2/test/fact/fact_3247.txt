Really. Please cite where Darwin discussed "Macro Evolution." What paper or book, and what chapter? What did he say about it that is hilarious. Have you actually read Darwin? Perhaps his paper on earth worms? Or maybe his paper on the formation of coral islands? I haven't read either of those or most of his other works. But I happen to have a copy of On The Origin Of Species and I can't find any discussion of "Macro Evolution". I even have an electronic version of Origin and a search of the text gives zero hits on "Macro Evolution" or "macroevolution" or even "macro-evolution." In fact, there are zero hits on "evolution."
