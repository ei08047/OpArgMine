I think that if Montalban is anything, he is opportunistic. Someone (Ungerdunn I think) pointed out to him that the phrase, "survival of the fittest" reduces to a tautology. As seems to be his bent, Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology. As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, "survival of the fittest" is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read "Origin" since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1?
But I will concede that "Origin" is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points. Essentially, a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless.
