It is entirely possible for a man armed with one hand grenade, and yes, hand grenades can be bought, to not only take out a tank, but kill everyone inside. All one would have to do is catch a tank on patrol, while it is at idle speed, jump up on the tank and toss the grenade down the tanks barrell. The explosion from the grenade would cause the shell in the tanks barrell to also explode, and then the rest of the ammo in the tank, and wallah, dead crew and no more opperable tank. As far as a plane is concerned, almost all of todays planes are controlled by computers, at least the guidance and weapons systems, so I would try to bring a plane down with a simple computer. You tell one planes weapons to target another plane, and boom, one less plane. Or one might dig a trench with which to trap a tank, and after a tank falls into the trench and gets stuck, you kill the exiting soldiers, pull the tank out, and now you have your very own tank. Of course, none of this is full proof, but it is highly possible.
