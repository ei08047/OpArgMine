Can you prove to me without  any  doubt that I am talking to you. I could really be your imagination talking to you, answering your own question in some weird, perverse way. I am merely an illusion, your sub-conscious.
Point being: asking for 100% proof or you don't buy it is sophistry--very close to solipsism, in fact, and was discredited as a theory of epistemology many thousands of years ago.
