No it's not. There never was a Noahs ark. There was nothing to be found. The Jews ripped the story off from the Sumerian story of Gilgamesh. The bible contains nothing more than half-truths and comic-book science. If the entire Earth was covered by water as the "story" suggests, then where did all of that extra water go? Oh wait that's right, even though the Earth is a closed biosphere, according to delusional religious pawns like grizzly6626 the water must have been vacuumed up by space aliens for use on their own planet, or maybe noah snapped his fingers and it just magically disappeared. LOL emoticonXBye grizzly6626, if you were half as smart as you 'think' you are then you'd realize that if there were that much water covering the surface of the Earth then the atmosphere would have become inhabitable. Oops... guess faith and fact don't mix? LOL emoticonXGood
Only a fool would believe what the the bible says about "Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came on the earth." 
Here is a more simplistic explaination. Enjoy emoticonXGood
