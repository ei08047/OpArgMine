And I have left them feedback to see what happens. I noticed this particular entry was sourced from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition so it is not something Dictionary.com wrote. 
I can see Iuris' point but the entry is still laid out wrong if this is the case. As written, "Godlessness; immorality", implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym. I think this is because some use the term "godless", an adjective, to mean immoral but "godlessness", a noun, to mean atheistic.
