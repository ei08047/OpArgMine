There is some truth here. Did you ever see "Independence Day"? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. It didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...
modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War II
not so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded.
US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. US still invaded.
