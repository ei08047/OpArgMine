Ah. Johnathan Wells is an evangilcal YEC who got his education in Biology to "disprove" evolution. He rejects science at all levels. I would not take serioiusly anybody associated with the 'discovery institute'. Mr Wells does have the advantage of having a better education that most of them, but his degree was gotten to promote Young Earth Creationism, and was paid for by Sun Yen Moon. 
I would say that the review is a bit high level, but accurate.
