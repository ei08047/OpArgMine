JPSartre12 can't point to anything inaccurate, so you see this mundane complaint that *you're posting something I don't like* ...
Quite frankly, if Christianity insists on trying to tell the government how it should perform marriages, I think that street should cut both ways and the government should be able to have input on how religion performs marriages...
JPSartre12's reply is reflective of the *anti-gay Christians are seeking discrimination against gays, but we're going to try to pretend we're the real victims while we bash them* school of thought.
