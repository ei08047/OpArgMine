So as a gay man I should be forced to accept hetero marriage. If I am forced to accept hetero marriage they should be forced to accept gay marriage. What part of equal protection do you not understand? I personally would like to see all displays of all religions wiped fron the public square. No one is going to dictate to me how to live my life based upon some outdated religious belief that I don't subscribe too.
