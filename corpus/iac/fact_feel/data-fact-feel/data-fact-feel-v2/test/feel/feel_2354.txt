Like they said in the article, you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers, you can say the baseball hurts men, because many of them get hurt. But most of the time its a great thing. Why then, would you suggest something so abusrd as to abortion hurts women. Most of the time, abortion lets women let go of that big weight thats holding them back and prusue their dreams, and live a happy life. Since when has AntiAbortionists cared about women? Can someone fill me in here?
