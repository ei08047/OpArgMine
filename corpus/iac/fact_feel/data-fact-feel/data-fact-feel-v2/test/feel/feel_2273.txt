Sorry to hear you say this. I have never attacked you personally, never said anything like what you accuse me of saying. I have characterized certain ideas, notions, and opinions as stupid and simple-minded, but not you personally. If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally, than obviously what I've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money.
