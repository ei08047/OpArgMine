And there you go again.. first of all, misrepresenting all the things everyone has said, and second of all, bringing up that red herring of 'In God We Trust'. 
You see, you are mixing up what your basic beliefs are with how you are acting. I do think it is very amusing that the Knights of Columbus, in an effort to 'show how different we are from the Godless Commies" have tricked the Christians of this country into the worshiping of Idols. They turned the pledge into a prayer, and the flag into an idol, and Money into a God.
Do keep on bringing up all these things about 'Noah's ark' and such. I guess you hear a sound bit on TV, and believe it hook line and sinker. It demonstrates to me what has to be changed in the schools on that we should teach people how to listen critically, and to actually learn things. I find that knowledge is the enemy of both religion and right wing fundamentalism. When people can actually learn and understand things on their own, and to be able to critically process information, they tend to stop being red neck fundamentalists, and can actually contribute to society.
