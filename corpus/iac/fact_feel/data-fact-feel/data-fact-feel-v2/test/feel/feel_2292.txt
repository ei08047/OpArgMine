Why?
Statistical testing cannot show something that is nonsensical to be either valid or invalid (prayer in this case)
1. Why would god be random in his choices? If he is random, why bother praying in the first place?
2. You could never actually verifiy that someone else somewhere in the world, or universe, wasn't praying for your control group, it simply couldn't be accurately tested.
3. What are we testing anyway? Nothing supernatural can be tested rationally, it's by definition irrational.
*4. OK, assume prayer is just "positive thought" whatever that means. Now, flip a coin 100 times and pray for heads every time. Statistical difference? no. How about write a quick random # generator to cycle through 10,000 coin flips and pray for heads every time. Find anything?
*(If you really think you CAN show an entirely random system can be influence to be non-random through prayer alone, don't tell me, tell Randy for $1 MILLION dollars! PS. You cannot :/ )

==========================================
unless:
1. You are doing so for the joy of performing the action.
2. Other's actually "like" you praying for them, or saying you pray for them, and you like the social "brownie points" you get by saying it.
