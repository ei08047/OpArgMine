Bigotry?? 
I have no idea what you mean there.
Anyway, I can't speak for the other thread, but I raised an issue that no pro-lifer has addressed, including you. So if you want to really have a discussion, start discussing instead of bickering.
Do you think that protesting a Planned Parenthood clinic might have an unintended consequence of discouraging someone from visiting who planned to obtain birth control, (or a Pap smear or other non-abortion service) thereby increasing the likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy (or cervical cancer, etc.)?
