Yet you have defined what unknowable is, therefore you know something of it; that it is unknowable. Not only that, I notice you've leapt away from the claim it doesn't exist.
But then, you must make the assumption that everything is knowable, if there's nothing unknowable. How do you show this? Well so far you've claimed that science MIGHT one day know everything about you. What a hoot.
