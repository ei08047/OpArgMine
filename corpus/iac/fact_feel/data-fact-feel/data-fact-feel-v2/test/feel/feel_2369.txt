Such personal attacks as yours indicate a bankruptcy of argument and reveal much about you while revealing nothing about me. If someone says that you are more likely to die in a car accident than in an airplane accident would accuse them of not caring about airplane accident victims? Would you accuse them of taking delight in the number of car deaths?
