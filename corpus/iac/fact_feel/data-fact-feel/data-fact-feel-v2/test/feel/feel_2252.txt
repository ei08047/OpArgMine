And again, how is this relevant to a discussion of science as opposed to "creation science?" What does virtue have to do with it? To be honest, I have never been impressed by the superior virtue of christians anyway. The highest divorce rate of any population in the country is among born again christians (Gallup). I haven't been divorced and have never cheated on my wife. Who is more virtuous?
