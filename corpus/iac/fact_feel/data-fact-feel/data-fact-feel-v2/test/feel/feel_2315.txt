Would you ask the same of an environmentalist? Would you ask him to pay for buying the all of the rainforests he hopes to save? The scientific research? etc. Would you ask this of any other cause except the abortion one? This is faulty reasoning. No one who supports any cause is expected to pay for the entirety of that cause. BUT anti-abortionists do pay for quite a bit in this regard. There are help centers all over the nation. Haven't you seen the signs? "Call if you are pregnant and in need of assistance."
