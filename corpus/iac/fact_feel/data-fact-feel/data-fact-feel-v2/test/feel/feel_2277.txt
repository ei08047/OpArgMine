I think that this is my view of it all as well. A lot of the events of the bible (mainly the old testament) are things that might have occured in one form or another, and much of the events of the New Testament DID occur.
An example of my view is that I think that the flood did happen. It all started as a very large flood (probably in a river valley) that was much larger than normal (say a "500-year-flood" or a larger discharge event), possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people, but some surviving leading to the Noah character. Eventually over the millenia, it got distorted and blown well out of proportion until it became a flood that covered the entire world. Then it led to the Epic of Gilgmesh, which was then adopted by those writing the early books of the Bible under the form it is seen as today.
