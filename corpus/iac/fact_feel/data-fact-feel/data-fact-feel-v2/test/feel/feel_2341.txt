I think your questions could be considered in a theological context. We're taught that we are a "special creation", made in God's image. Then as a added bonus he gave us dominion over other animals, which is a great source of boastfulness for some people (Consider the pride of a man, his chest swelling as he contemplates his intellectual superiority over a billy goat, for instance). This combination allows for the thinking that humans aren't natural in this world and are somehow above it all IMO, which leads to your observation of "arrogance".
