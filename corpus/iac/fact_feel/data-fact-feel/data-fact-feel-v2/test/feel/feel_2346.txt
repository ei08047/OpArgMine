Of course I believe an unborn fetus is simply an unborn child. The only difference is that the unborn has no means of survival without the mother and is not recognized as being a living person. I don't wish that this child should be killed, but as I said before it can be for the best. And if you really do believe in heaven, then the child is going there anyways. Why would you wish a life of suffering on it instead of being able to skip all that and go straight to heaven? This is the type of logic that works against those who believe in a soul since it really doesn't make much sense to live on Earth when heaven is a million billion times better.
Just to answer your question with a question, how do you know a child would choose life over death when it has never lived? People commit suicide everyday but I'm sure they would also choose life over death if they had been in a better situation. Perhaps this is being too extreme. A person would likely choose to live when faced with death, but whether it logically make sense is another question. People will try to live through starvation, sickness, and misery because it is what their mind tells them to do. Is it really best that they are alive?
