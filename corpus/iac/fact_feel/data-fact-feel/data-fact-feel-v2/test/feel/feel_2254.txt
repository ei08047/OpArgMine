As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.
Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.
