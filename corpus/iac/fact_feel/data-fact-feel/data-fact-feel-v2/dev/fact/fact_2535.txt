Well some of us at least tried to get you to learn more. But I seriously doubt that you would be banned for not having a biology degree, I rather suspect other factors came into play. Certainly I never have complained to any moderators about your posts. I rather suspect nobody has, indeed I rather suspect you catalyzed any banning yourself, but I do not see how since you are rather mild mannered (but more verbal) than the average creo.
