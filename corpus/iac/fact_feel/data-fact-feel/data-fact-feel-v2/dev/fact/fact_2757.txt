So you don't believe that God took a rib from Adam's side to create woman? 
Genesis 2:21-23 "So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, 
"This is now bone of my bones 
and flesh of my flesh; 
she shall be called 'woman,' 
for she was taken out of man." 
lurch:
I don't have time to quote everything you said so I'll just comment on it. 
You guys keep saying that "of course, religion and science can co-exist perfectly". When did I say that they couldn't? I simply said that fundamentalist Christianity and evolution could not co-exist. Catholics are a perfect example, they do not believe that they can pray to God directly. They believe that they have to pray through a priest, saint, etc. That is not fundamentalist Christianity. You keep trying to make an argument out of something that I am not arguing about. 
You also say that creationism cannot co-exist with "science". You say that evolution is science. If creationism can't co-exist with evolution, then how can there be any evolution believing Christian fundamentalists? (thistown for example.) Creationism, by the way, is used very broadly. It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we "evolved". They can be used to mean the same thing if you are a Christian who believes in evolution.
BTW, science isn't the "evil work of Satan". It's man's way of trying to explain something so that they don't have to believe in something that threatens the way they enjoy living. (The Bible.)
