The claim that only through a belief in the Biblical God - or any God - can right and wrong be known is completely stupid. 
1) Ever hear of humanism? 
2) EVEN CHIMPS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING TREATED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY! AND EVEN CHIMPS HAVE BEEN SEEN TO DO FOR OTHERS WHAT THEY WOULD WANT DONE FOR THEM!
EDIT: Excuse, I double checked and I was wrong ... but that's BAD news for the Creationist!
EVEN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS - WHICH ARE NOT AS RELATED TO HUMANS AS ARE CHIMPS - HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THEY ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY OR NOT!!!

Chimps take this one step farther by adding into the mix how closely their social bonds are to the other participant. So chimps have a more complex sense of fairness than do capuchin monkeys.
