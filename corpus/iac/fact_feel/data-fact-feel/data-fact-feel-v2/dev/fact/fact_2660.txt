So you were unable to see evidence of erosion in the pictures that I showed you? By the way, the fossils are not bone - they are rock. They are a different kind of rock that the sedimentary rock in which they are found. Perhaps if you actually educated yourself you would know that the fossils are usually much harder than the surounding sediment. Of course, anyone who made an effort to learn before speaking would know that.
