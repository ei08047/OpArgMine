And how would they be able to trace those 30 percent back to gun shows, if there are no background checks carried out? Hm? Care to explain that one for the rest of the class?
If they're coming from private transactions, then there's no record, and the number made up is pure BS. If they came from a licensed dealer who was doing business at a gun show, then it would be no different from them being traced to a licensed gun store.
