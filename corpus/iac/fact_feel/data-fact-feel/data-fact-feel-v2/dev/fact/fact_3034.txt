I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!
