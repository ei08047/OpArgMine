Yes, I would. The term is not simply just words. The definition of Civil Unions do not allow for the over 1,100 rights, liberties and protections granted to otherwise Legally Married couples. Civil Unions are non-transportable, meaning a civil union from one state cannot be recognized in other states. 
Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage, fine. That goes for heterosexuals as well. I just can't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into a "civil union" being as they would be denied spousal recognitions and transportability. 
I have als been asked before, in another forum, if I would be opposed to leaving the decission up to individual states. My answer is, yes. Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition, benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states. 
Also we all know what would have happened if individual states were allowed to have determined women's right to vote, interracial marriage and de-segragation. None of those would have happened. 
Sometimes the general public just doesn't know what's best for their state's citizens. Much of the voting public is simply just too under-informed or misinformed. 
HR3313 (Protection of Marriage Act) and DOMA...MUST be repealed and steps to make all rights equal must be taken. 
The issue of gay marriage rights is indeed a civil rights issue. There is no way around it.
