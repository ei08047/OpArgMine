The word "evolution'" generally means change, not "advance", so we can speak of "stellar evolution" or the evolution of a planetary surface. These are each large fields of science with many people studying them. The "biological Theory of Evolution" is completely different. From my viewpoint coming from the physical sciences, at the present time, the "Theory of Evolution", which is the study of how genetic material changes over time, has become so completely validated by making so many accurate and useful predictions, that it can now just be considered biology.
What most creationists seem to be disputing is just science, since they don't specify, and use the term "evolution" too broadly.
