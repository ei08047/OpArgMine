But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.
You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.
Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.
