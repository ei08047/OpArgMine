What statements?
If you are referring to the 600 prophesies mentioned above... consider that I could write down a prophesy today about something that will happen tomorrow. Then tomorrow, I could either act out that which I wrote down the previous day in order to fulfill the prophesy. OR I could just write down a description of me fulfilling that particular prophecy and pass it off as me actually fulfilling the prophesy. In this manner, the probability of me fulfilling the prophecy is 100%. Because I made it happen.
