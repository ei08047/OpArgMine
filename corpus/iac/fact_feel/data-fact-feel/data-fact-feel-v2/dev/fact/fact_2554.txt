Actually, if you want to check, you will find that biologists themselves will point out the holes. We still have a lot to learn. Many of the holes have been closed even in my lifetime and the creationist god-of-the-gaps is being reduced to smaller and smaller gaps. But if you want a creationist to "join the real world", you're going to have to do more than be offensive and insulting. You might present some actual facts to support your position. Of course, I presume that you will actually educate yourself before presenting the facts.
Have a nice day.
