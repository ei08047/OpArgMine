Sorry, I don’t know PA’s law or if there is a link to it. Va follows the old common law rules for self defense. 
From what I have read of the new (and much criticized by the media elite) Florida self defense bill, it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense, where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force. The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it. The reporter said with disbelief in his voice (the kind of “my God what are they doing!” panic you hear when someone passes a law they don’t like) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime. My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system. Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime, whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America, that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy:
THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction.
There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.
A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.
In any event, I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the “wild, wild west,” “traffic accidents becoming shootouts,” and Fla. becoming the “gunshine state.” These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law. I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then.
