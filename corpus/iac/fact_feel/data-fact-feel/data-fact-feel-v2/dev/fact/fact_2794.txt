Actually the injunction is in place until the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decides. After that point, and if they decide the ruling was correct, then the injunction is done with (unless the 9th circuit issues its own similar injunction).
It's not going to go straight to the Supreme Court.
And, unless I'm mistaken, I believe that if the 9th circuit agrees such a law is unconstitutional, the areas they preside over that have similar laws will have those made null by that decision. IIRC that's how it works.
