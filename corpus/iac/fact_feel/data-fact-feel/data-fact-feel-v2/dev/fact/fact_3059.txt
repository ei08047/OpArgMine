Actually I have read the entire Bible and it never mentioned Harry Potter - even once. People who don't see Harry Potter are SILLY! Especially since this latest one is awesome. Very funny. Harry Potter is about witchcraft like Star Wars is about NASA. This is the same silly as those who fretted over the DaVinci Code. It's FICTION. 
By the way you spelled "jerks" wrong.
