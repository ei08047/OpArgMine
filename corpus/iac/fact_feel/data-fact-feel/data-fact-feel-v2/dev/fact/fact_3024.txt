"The use of Pepper Spray is legal for carrying by a person 18 years of age or older"
"Some examples of misuse include; spraying on people in anger, as a joke, possession of by prohibited persons; minors, drug addicts or persons convicted of felonies."
Don't know where you got that.
I was watching a reality TV show (my DVR quit on me) about court files. A CA jury sentenced a teenage girl to 22 years of hard time for stabbing a 47 year old man when he tried to rape her. Assuming this is true (which it could not be due to the fact that its reality TV), how can the jury sleep at night? The defense proved that the man often made violent sexual advances on women, and the 17 year old girl was not inherently violent. She was convicted on second degree murder and sentenced to the maximum possible amount of time. Seriously, this is one F*cked up state. I can't even believe something like that would happen in this day and age.
