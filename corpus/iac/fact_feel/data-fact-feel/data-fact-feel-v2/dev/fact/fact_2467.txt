The bible is evidence. Its existence is a fact. What that fact represents is subject to interpretation. Ken's argument is that choosing to believe the bible is infallible is no more or less of a presupposition than choosing to believe that logic is infallible. He's right in absolute terms, but those axioms are not equally congruent with reality.
