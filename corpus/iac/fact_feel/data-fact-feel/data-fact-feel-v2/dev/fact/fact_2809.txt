Again, I don't know what happenstance origins are, but ruling something out because it's unlikely doesn't work. I have made the poker analogy very often. If you are dealt in order, the 3 of spades, then the 5 of hearts, then the 9 of clubs, then the 4 of diamonds, then the 6 of hearts, would you decide immediately that it was not true? The odds are (1/52)*(1/51)*(1/50)*(1/49)*(1/48) = 1/311,875,200.
This could be done for multiple games. The odds get slimmer and slimmer, but the difference is that something had to happen. No matter what cards you got, the odds of you getting the same card in that order would be this slim.
