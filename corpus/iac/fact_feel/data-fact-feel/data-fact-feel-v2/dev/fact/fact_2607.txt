I have yet to see any conclusive evidence that this is true and undeniable.
You wanna prove in an undeniable manner that developed nations around the world have fewer deaths than America? Then get cracking and gather the evidence. Start proving that the various governments around the world aren't lying about their annual death rates. The UK has been found guilty of continuously altering statistics to make themselves look safer than they really are.
So do you have any proof that the annual number of deaths of a country like Germany, are the true number and not some government sponsored, people's friendly statement to make people feel less afraid?
