So just do what you say you are. And by the way we already know why fruit eating primates and their descendants lack a working copy of GLUO. Its been lost in SOME of the species in which it was not useful, and of course in species where it was useful it could not be lost since any individual carrying a defective gene would DIE and fail to REPRODUCE. Natural selection you understand!
