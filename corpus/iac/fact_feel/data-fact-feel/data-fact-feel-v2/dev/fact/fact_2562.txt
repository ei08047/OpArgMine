Actually to an anti-gunner than equilivant slander and propagada is perfectly logical.
Please see how the NRA is equated with the KKK by an anti-gunner:
"In an animated history send-up, with the narrator talking rapidly, Bowling equates the NRA with the Klan, suggesting NRA was founded in 1871, "the same year that the Klan became an illegal terrorist organization." Bowling goes on to depict Klansmen becoming the NRA and an NRA character helping to light a burning cross."
