No disagreements.
Something left out (probably because it was assumed), is memory.
What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity. 
To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity. 
There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity, but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required, and without a brain, there is no mind, so a brain is required.
It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain, there is no person.
Of course, others will disagree.
Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity, but if this is true, identical twins (with identical DNA) would have to share one personal identity, and one soul.
In the case of a chimera, two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes, would have to blend into one person/soul. (No, most chimeras are not schizophrenic).
I believe an integral part of [personal identity>mental existence>personhood] is memory. Whether it is short term, or long term, without memory there is no sense of self. (I may be stating the obvious, but you never know.)

It is not clear if your list of indicators for mental existence is “one will suffice”, or “several are required”.
I don’t think it matters all that much, but I’m not sure, just wondering.
