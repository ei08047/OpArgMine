This is the argument concerning 'choice' that, to me, rings untrue and is a potential weak point. The whole 'when does life begin/when is it human?' isn't where those that favor woman's rights should stake their claim. I support a woman's right to control her body and I feel that one of the best ways to 'judge' a culture is to see how they treat women. I think that it is imperative to allow a women to control her body, regardless of when life begins, etc... Now I also abhor abortions and I extol responsibility. However, #$%( happens and a woman MUST be able to retain the ability to decide what to do in the event of an unexpected pregnancy. Now, considering responsibility important, I can understand and appreciate time limits and whatnot, because that is humane. But we should call a spade a spade... a fetus is or will be human and an abortion does 'kill' it. Its horrible that it happens, but we have to allow women that right.
