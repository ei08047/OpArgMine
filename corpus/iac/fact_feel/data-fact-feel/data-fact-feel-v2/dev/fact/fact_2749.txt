Here is how the exchange went down. Person one. We need to teach morals to our students. Person two. Well if you do that, who's morals will you teach? I may disagree.
No one could answer that question so they taught no morals. 
I think we should start by agreeing that things like, but not exclusively, murder, stealing, and hate is wrong. Teach that in which we can agree!
