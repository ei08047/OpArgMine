So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.
What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.
The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.
