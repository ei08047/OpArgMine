Attending church cuts risk of death?
Methinks your little website is biased.
As for stem cell research, I am for whatever works best. We should not compromise on something worse than stem cells because of a moral issue. Stem cells are simply cells, nothing more. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.
However, if adult stem cells hold the key, and are more promising than embryotic stem cells, fine. Whatever works best, but this is not a moral debate. This is a science debate. To suggest this has something to do with advocating for a woman's right to abortion is absurd. This is about helping people only, born people. Real people.
