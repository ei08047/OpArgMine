And the issue of having separate white and black schools, dining rooms and drinking fountains and bus seats, was only about schools, dining rooms, drinking fountains and bus seats. It wasn't an issue about people. Those seats at the back of the bus were just as comfortable as the seats at the front. No need for blacks to complain about being at the back of the bus. They could learn at black schools, and don't have to be in white schools. Blacks could eat just as well in the "colored" dining rooms. They didn't have to be at the "white" eating counter. Inter-racial marriage was not about black people, even though they were forbidden from marrying a white person, it was about marriage.
