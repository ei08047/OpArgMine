Oh, is THAT where you are getting your anti-evolution information: The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book dealing with biology that was written not by a biologist, but by an engineer...right? Walter James ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And gee whiz, biologists don't agree with ReMine ... how strange! :-)
PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine himself when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.
