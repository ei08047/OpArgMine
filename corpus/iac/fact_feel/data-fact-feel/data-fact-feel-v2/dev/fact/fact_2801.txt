While 'commonly' may or may not be true, this does end up happening at least some of the time (and possibly a lot of the time). It's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent... for example, a woman enters a clinic because she's confused and thinking about getting an abortion... she wants to consider the option of abortion, though she's not really comfortable with the idea. The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure, and that lasting psychological effects rarely (if ever) occur. The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman's life. I'd encourage you to read the book "Forbidden Grief" by Theresa Burke. It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions, and the experiences they have gone through. Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion. (In reality, short of physical force, no one can 'force' you to do something you don't want to do, but things can be said and done to mislead a person --intentionally or otherwise-- into thinking that's what they want themselves.)
