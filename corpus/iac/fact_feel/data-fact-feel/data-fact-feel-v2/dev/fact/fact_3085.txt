I have had a quick glance over the article that you gave us on the link. That is strange that they claim that they have evidence that destroys Dr Russell Humphreys Relativistic Cosmology, when the AiG (a major creationist organisation) have stated that Dr Humphreys has thus far been able to solve the problem of distant starlight. If what you say is true, than most disturbing this is. I have sent an email to the editorial team at Answers in Genesis for their response. They should reply in a week or so. But the only thing that is different between the big bang and the new Cosmology is the starting assumptions, i.e. bounded and un-bounded universe.
