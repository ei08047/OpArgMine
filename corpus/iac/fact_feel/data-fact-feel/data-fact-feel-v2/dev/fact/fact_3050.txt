And did you ever hear that it's not always a penalty but sometimes a benefit? And did you know that if it would be a penalty, you're free to simply not file your taxes jointly, which results in no penalty at all? And certainly with respect to insurance, there are many benefits bestowed by marriage, as cmitch06 pointed out.
This of course doesn't factor in the countless other benefits of marriage, such as naturalization, food stamps, veteran's benefits, housing benefits, greater ability to take out a loan, visitation rights, property rights, etc.
