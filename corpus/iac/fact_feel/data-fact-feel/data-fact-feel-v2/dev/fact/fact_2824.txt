Well, ok. You're right. 
Now that I think about it, "missing links" and "transitional fossils" aren't really the same thing.
All species are potentially transitional, in that if the line continues it will change eventually, maybe even split.
But missing links are something different.
It's just a fossil that shows some relationship between other fossils and that's really all.
