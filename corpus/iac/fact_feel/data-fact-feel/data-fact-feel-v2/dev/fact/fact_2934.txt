This crushes ToE at the most fundamental level. I've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is. The popultion has been told for decades that they are simply a culmination of their genes. How many times have you heard, "It's in the genes...."???? Not only that but the whole theory of evolution is a result of changes in genes (or alleles). Ha! Now, however, genes are "losing their glitter." Now, it's RNA that seems to be "running the show." How can it get anymore embarrassing for science that they got the premise wrong for all these years? Why do you think the dude in the article said how "depressing" all this is? Evolutionists have screwed up in that they have always assumed that the gene is the fundamental unit of life, that complexity goes no further down in the organism and that what determines what or who you are stops at your genes! FALSE! DNA does not dictate who we are, it's the other way around: DNA is just a representative of what we are, where we live, what our social environment is, what our ecological environment is, etc. DNA is not a dictator of life nor does it define us......it's a follower of life and is manipulated by who we are. This reality indeed flips all of biology and ToE on its head. You can deny it all you want -- and I'm sure you will because you have completely brainwashed yourself. 
The sun is setting on ToE. Science has lead us astray for decades, and now it's coming back to bite them. What an embarrassment.
