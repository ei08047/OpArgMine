I think the christians you describe do not disregard creation in Genesis per sae. They would agree absolutely with your 2 fundemental truths at the start of your post. However, they do not see it as a history as such, but more as an analogy to what happened. Some take it simply to say that God created the universe and put a soul in humans and find the detail of that (not the soul bit) in what we have discovered through science. Others would say it becomes "historical" at a certain point- Adam and Eve or maybe Noah. I don't think they are any less christian than those who choose to believe the story of creation literally, and it would surprise me to hear someone say that was the case.
I think it does pose some awkward questions to hold such a view though, and while I don't see all your 8 examples in your later post as being the ones I have heard, they are certainly of that nature.
Christianity has struggled with the logical conclusions of observation of the physical world for much time. Some of the examples from history are amusing today- the Omphilodian Heresy where the very discussion of whether Adam and Eve had navels was a heinous religous crime. The Heliocentricity debate where the Catholic Church eventually relented their scripture based denial of the earth orbiting the sun. And today the debate over the old earth and evolution.
This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth. While this helps to create a powerful system of belief, it can put it in an awkward position when new discovery is made. The nature of peolpe seems to be the same conflicts have arisen again and again- with just the point of contention changing.
