Won't work. "danger to the mother's life" has to cover allowing an abortion if there is a significant risk of psychological damage which might lead to suicide. Any doctor, especially in a country like yours with a runaway litigation culture, faced with "I will kill myself and the baby if you don't abort" will decide there is a significant risk (to his wallet mainly). It is for this reason that "convenience abortions" are technically illegal here in the UK, but they occur anyway.
