Actually, Simone, if you spend more time on their website and research a little deeper, you will find that they are also "right wing wingnuts" but they happen to want "sensible" gun policies in order to eliminate violence (clearly delineated from war) with the use of guns in all countries.
Essentially they are the ones you are griping about and stereotyping. Provide a decent basis of argument besides a stereotype please.
