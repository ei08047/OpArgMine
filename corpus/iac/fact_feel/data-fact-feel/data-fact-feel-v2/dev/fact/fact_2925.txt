I'm not sure what you mean by either genetic determinism or neo-darwinism, but there is no contradiction between multi-purpose genes and evolution by natural selection, or the principle that genotypic alterations have a phenotypic expression. Just because a gene may have more than one function, or multiple genes make contribute to a single characteristic, doesn't make any substantive difference to the theory of evolution, which you should recall was inititally developed before there was any understanding of genetics at all.
