No. According to current cosmology, hydrogen atoms were able to form about 3 minutes after the big bang when the background radiation fell to a level below that of the binding energy of atomic nuclei. During this period the synthesis of several light nuclei occurred - hydrogen, deuterium (heavy hydrogen), helium, and lithium.
In fact, we don't know what caused the big bang. Our physics doesn't seem to apply to conditions before about 10^-43 sec after the big bang. There is some speculation about quantum events, but nothing solid yet. When the big bang was first proposed by a Jesuit priest, Einstein rejected it. Einstein "believed" in a steady state universe. Only after Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding did Einstein accept the idea of a point origin for the universe. The Pope called the big bang the moment of creation.
