Anti-gunners. Why do you HATE our Constitutions Bill of Rights? Why do you persecute people who can pass a background check not only once, but every time they purchase a new gun? You told America that this would satisfy you, when this new law was proposed! But NO! You demonize us anyway! We prove our lawfulness not only when we purchase a new gun, but also CCW people have to pass another background check when they apply for a Concealed Handgun License, then take a test and classes to boot?
  We already have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws.  When are you going to be reasonable?
So what's the deal? Why do you HATE America so much? Why do you HATE us law-abiding people who keep our noses clean all of our lives? Heck, I am 62 and have never run afoul of our laws. Do you think we are going to start now? 
Descent and public discourse is fine, but I surely hope you folks are not planning violence against our Great and Unique Country! You often sound like it is possible when you complain incessantly about our Constitution, our Rights and the laws of this nation governing the peaceful use and ownership of firearms.
