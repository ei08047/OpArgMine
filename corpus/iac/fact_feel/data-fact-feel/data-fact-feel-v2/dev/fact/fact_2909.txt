I see that you missed to point. I was correcting you lack of knowledge about carbon 14 dating. You think that you can date fossils of this age with carbon. You also seem to think that you can date rocks with carbon 14. You can't. Time after time you reveal your ignorance by your inability to respond appropriately. KNM-WT 15000 was dated from stratigraphic studies of the area and dating of specific, appropriate rock samples from above and below the fossils.
