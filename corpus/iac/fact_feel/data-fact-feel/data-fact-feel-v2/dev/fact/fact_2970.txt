Please explain how ID is suppressed. It is taught as a hypothesis currently, and even if it were banned from being mentioned in schools, scientists can still do all the research they want on it. And you should know censorchip usually makes the idea more popular, just as banning the f word makes more people use it. Scientists would do research on ID, there is no suppression.
You have shown how there may be benefit if there is a God and we assume ID is true. No specific examples, and no proof it's true. This is simply a guess, a "theory" as used in normal terms. In the science terms that would be a hypothesis. It is currently taught as a hypothesis.
The point comes down to the fact that the debate isn't about whether it should be taught as a hypothesis, but whether it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. You have admitted that not only does evolution have a lot of evidence, it has also led to many contributioins in science.
You are the affirmative so it is up to you to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. So far you have shown that it's an interesting idea, that may in the future lead to some good things. But you have failed to prove that it is in any way even close to the theory of evolution.
