You can't accuse others of 'slight (sic) of hand' and then produce this! The same Home Office survey you linked to shows: 
17% of total violent crime was 'common assault with NO injury' (i.e. pushing and shoving, spitting at someone or verbal abuse) 
43% was 'common assault with less serious injury' (e.g, a scuffle outside a bar)
20% were 'harrassment - no injuries suffered.
5% were 'other violent crimes' including carrying a weapon.
Only 2.1% of all violent crime led to a serious injury.
The weapon most commonly used is, of course, the fist - in 78% of all cases. 
In order to make this comparison make any sense we need to know how the FBI defines violent crime.
