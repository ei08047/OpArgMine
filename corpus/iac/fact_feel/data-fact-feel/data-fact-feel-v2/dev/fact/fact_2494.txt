Which are based on old information. The SOHO project (with which I was indirectly involved, and know some of the participants) was launched on December 2, 1995 specifically to make high precision measurements of the sun, especially the oscillations of the size of the surface, which indicate details of the interior. To quote them:
Is the Sun expanding or contracting, and at what rate?
(For an overview of the controversy over solar diameter variations, I recommend John Gribbin's pre-SOHO book, Blinded By the Light: The Secret Life of the Sun, published in 1991)
The Sun is not currently expanding or contracting to any measurable extent. It may in fact be shrinking or swelling, but we have no hard data with which to conclude that.
It is vibrating, however:

In addition, we expect that the Sun will someday expand into a red giant phase, but that won't be for another 4 billion to 5 billion years or so.

So, have you worked out the length of a day would have been 1 billion years ago?
