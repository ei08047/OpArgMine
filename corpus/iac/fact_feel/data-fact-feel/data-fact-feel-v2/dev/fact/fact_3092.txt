o_c hit the nail on the head. The intent is to encourage sexual responsibility. The problem is that this is what Planned Parenthood does. These numbskull protesters have their idea of what sexual responsibility is: abstinence outside of marriage. The problem is that this is a pipe dream; you won't stop people from having sex using threats and scare tactics. Instead, the only thing this fearmongering accomplishes is scaring people into being caught with contraceptives by authority figures, so they don't have any... but they still have sex. Contrastingly, PP encourages proper and effective contraception and sexual health.
Only an idiot can't see which one goes farther toward preventing the abortions that those XXXXXX are protesting in the first place.
