Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.
What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.
It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.
