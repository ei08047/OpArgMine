No, I wasn't looking for religious morality, I was looking for general morality, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate. Anyway, what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing? There are already a lot of people in the world, and too many more will end up using up all the food, and then there will no people, because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation. Heterosexuality is good, without any reproduction we would die out as well, but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples, the population would increase even more.
