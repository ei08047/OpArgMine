Actually, YES I HAVE! Not recently, but every time a cop has ever told me to sign a ticket he has made it clear that signing it isn't an admission of guilt, just an acknowledgment of receiving it. It is SOP for cops to say this with every ticket which requires a signature. And these cops said it to her also. She's either stupid or was looking for any lousy excuse to refuse to cooperate, and then justify her refusal to cooperate with them which is why the Court rejected her argument and threw out her case ala they upheld her conviction and nullified her attempt to unlawfully enrich herself over an issue which she caused herself. Only a knee jerk and emotionally bent liberal like you would defend a scavenger like her who will create any bogus issue possible to make an illegal buck from a fallacious claim.
