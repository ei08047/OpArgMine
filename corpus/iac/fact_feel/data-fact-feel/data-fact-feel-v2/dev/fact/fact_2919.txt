What early days are you talking about?
In ancient Greece, everything was about logic and order and was put into a polytheistic context. Then Aristotle came along and gave us "emprical" thought.
When christianity rolled onto the scene, most "science" of those first 1700 years (mostly things like astrology and alchemy) were seen as witchcraft and such and was persecuted.
Maybe you mean the early days of modern science, starting around the enlightenment period. This was the time of a rise in secular humanism and science was largely an extension of that philosophy. They used to just call it "natural philosophy" and it was usually at odds with church doctrine. There are, of course, exceptions to this, but on the whole science was not favored by the church. So any "creation science" going on was just a bunch of theologians arguing. (actually I do remember reading about late 18th century geologists trying to fit what they found, including fossils, into a Biblical Noah's Ark context, and then they eventually had to scrap it because things stopped fitting, and quite often)

I never knew all those common chemistry words came from arabic.
