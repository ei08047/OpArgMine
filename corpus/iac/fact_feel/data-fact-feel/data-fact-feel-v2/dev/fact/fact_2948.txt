Just look at the dates on your sources: 1969, 1978, 1981, 1977, 1980, 1981, 1981, 1983, 1970. Your most recent source is 25 years old and that one is from a creationist source. You've got to be kidding me. I also notice that you claim to have had a private conversation with Andrew Ingersol in which you pointed out an error that he had made. I suspect that you are a liar or a thief. But of course! You are a creationist!
I also notice that you don't seem to have made an attempt to educate yourself by checking out the sources I gave you. Moreover, you still haven't presented any evidence for creation. You keep claiming that there is some. Why do you refuse to present it?
