And with the possible exception of collecting, Australian licensing laws allow all of the above. I should know I have lived and shot over there. The idea of such laws is to remove weapons from those who have no good reason to own such things, and put extra safety restrictions on those who do.
For the record, I do not actually agree with such stringent measures myself. But I don't think your argument really holds water. 
And to make such associations with tyranny is exagerated to say the least.
