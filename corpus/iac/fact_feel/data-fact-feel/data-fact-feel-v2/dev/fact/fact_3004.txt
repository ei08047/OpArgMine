The title of the thread gives a false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage. Had the title said, pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage, his position would have appeared as obvious as his views are. She is attempting to make it sound like the christian community is split, but bible believing pastors wouldn't be caught dead endorsing what this pastor believes in any aspect of his so called faith.
