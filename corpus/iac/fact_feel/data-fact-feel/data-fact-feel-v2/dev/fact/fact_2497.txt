Actually polygamy is about one man marrying more than one woman. It is a heterosexual insitution. By your argument, it is traditional man/woman marriage that is the slippery slope to this "broadening" of marriage. You do not see any same-sex couples asking for a legal marriage for multiple partners. That is the realm of the straights, and all of them is mighty religious, as well.
