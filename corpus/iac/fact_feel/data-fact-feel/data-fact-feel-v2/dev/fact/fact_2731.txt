So it's not safe to go to school because your teacher might kill you if you're late at turning in your homework?
Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare; you'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date, and released from prison due to a favor from a politician.
But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country. If you're attacked, you're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you. Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon, you're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm.
