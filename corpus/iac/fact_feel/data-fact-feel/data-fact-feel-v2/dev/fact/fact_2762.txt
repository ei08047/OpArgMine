The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science.
