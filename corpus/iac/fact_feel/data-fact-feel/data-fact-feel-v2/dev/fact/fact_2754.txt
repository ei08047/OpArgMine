If that was not possible evolution would be impossible, it is direct evidence that evolution isn't impossible not that evolution exists. The same can be said for adaptation, natural selection, and mutation. They are all concepts that evolution stands on but their existance does not necessitate evolutions.
For instance if I had the theory: when heavy ceramic objects fall on top of one another a very few super energetic particles fly outwards and cause leaves to fall.
I could offer the fact that leaves and bricks do in fact fall, as "evidence" for my theory but it would not be in any way that the rising and setting of the sun was not evidence for both rotation and orbit.
