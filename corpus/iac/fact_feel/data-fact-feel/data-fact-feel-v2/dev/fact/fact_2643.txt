You know, I think that you are rather an evil person, trying to create guilt where no guilt exists, where no guilt is necessary. Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth. It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it's well in the past, except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it.
Why don't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq, for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children, for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives.
But, I guess that when one worships the Almighty Fetus, the lives of real people are of no concern.
