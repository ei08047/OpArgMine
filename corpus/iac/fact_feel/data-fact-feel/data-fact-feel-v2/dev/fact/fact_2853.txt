So, if I whack you in the head with a baseball bat and you become a vegitable, where did your soul go? If you are still alive and wearing diapers and drooling, is your ability to reason purely "physical material"? How are your brain cells more than the sum of their parts? If the mind exists as something more than the physical operation of the physical brain, why does it disappear when the brain is damaged?
