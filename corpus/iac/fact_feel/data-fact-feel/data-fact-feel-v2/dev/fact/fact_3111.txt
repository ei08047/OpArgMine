That , of course, is the logical fallacy known as 'Personal incredibility". The concept he promoted of "irreducilble complex" has been shown to be devoid of any meaning. All example he showed of 'gaps' in systems he proclaimed to be 'irredibly complex' have been shown to be reducible. Some were even found to be reducible even BEFORE his book "Darwin's black box' was published. Those gaps in knowledge were filled in.
What Behe was basiclaly saying is 'Gosh, we don't know, it must have been God'. We found out. God retreats. Yes, there are unknowns, and probably always will be. But our ignornace is not evidence of an intelligent designer.
To promote an intelligent designer as a scientific theory, you have to have evidence FOR an intellient designer, rather than gaps in the knowlege of how 
biochemical systems formed.
Believing in a God is fine, but it isn't science.
