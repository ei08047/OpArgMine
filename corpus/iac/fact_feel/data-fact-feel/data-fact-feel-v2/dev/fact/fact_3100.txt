Fossil record shows sorting largely by complexity, not density. Huh. That's magic water!
Geological record lacks a uniform layer of sediment similar to the K-T iridium layer. Magic water again!
Geological record doesn't support massive geological changes happening in 4,000 years. Magic Land perhaps? 
Basic marine organisms can't tolerate massive salinity changes. Maybe Noah had a giant magical aquarium? emoticonXKill
