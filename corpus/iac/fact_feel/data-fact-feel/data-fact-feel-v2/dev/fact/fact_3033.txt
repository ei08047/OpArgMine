I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful. Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.
I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.
I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)
I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.
I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency. 
There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them. How do you feel about marxism, socialism and communism, and why?
