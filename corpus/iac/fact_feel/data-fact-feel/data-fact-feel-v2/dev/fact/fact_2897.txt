Public policy protects us -or at least attempts to- from really unhealthy foods through nutritional information labels. People who choose to eat unhealthy foods do so despite knowing that doing so may lead to health problems. Besides being careful not to get into situations where you are likely to be shot, people don't have much control over whether or not someone pulls a gun on them, and that is why most people are more afraid of being killed by someone else's gun than their own eating habits.
