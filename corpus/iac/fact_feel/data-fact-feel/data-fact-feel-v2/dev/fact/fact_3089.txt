See above regarding the nature of proof. What other plausible explanation is there? We have transitional fossils from so many strata between so many species, genetic markers in extant species indicating common ancestry - all life on earth dances to the common-descent beat. Yet you want us to make a special exception for humans, despite the exact same consillience between fossil evidence, genetic evidence, everything. You want us to hold in abeyance the conclusion that we share a common ancestor with the other apes, yet you can provide no remotely plausible alternative explanation.
There comes a point where a thing not only looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, but swims, lays eggs, gets gang-raped by drakes and has 'DUCK' tattooed on it in large, friendly letters. At which point, continuing to insist that there's no proof it's a duck is starting to sound just a little bit silly.
