“Fruit” is a name we give to identify a physical object; the laws of logic are not physical.
When you say “fruit” exists you can show its existence in the physical world. If the laws of logic exist, then show me. For one thing, atheism cannot account for a universal concept that is not material, and does not depend on our thinking. In addition to that, I am using the same argument atheist’s use against the existence of God to get the atheist to show me the existence of the laws of logic. Atheists say, “Show me God” I cannot see him. Theist describe that the universe cannot exist without God by showing the affects of God in the material universal (design) Show me the laws of logic, where is it? I cannot see it. Using apples is describing it is not the law itself. Just like I describe the evidence of Gods existence.
The laws or logic are not universal? Again, you are using matter to show something that is non-material, I can look at fruit until I am blue in the face but that only describes concepts, it is not the laws of logic itself.
