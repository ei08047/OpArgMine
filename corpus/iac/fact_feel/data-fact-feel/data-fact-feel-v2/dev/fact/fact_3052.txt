Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.
Barbarian observes:
It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.
And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.
