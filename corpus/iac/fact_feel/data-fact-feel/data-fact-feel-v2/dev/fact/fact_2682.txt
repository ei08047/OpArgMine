Actually, you have been lied to here from my knowledge. The fossil record does not show "in-between types". Darwin said that the absence of such intermediates was the "most obvious and serious objection" against his theory. Nearly 150 years later, Dr David Raup, the head of one of the great museums in America, said that the situation concerning missing links "hasn't changed much" and that "we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwins times." The Late Dr Colin Patterson was Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History as well an being an evolutionist and a fossil expert. He wrote a significant book on evolution - but when someone asked him why he did not show any pictures of in-between forms in his book, he wrote the following:
"I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutinoary transitinos in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the informatino from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic licence, would htat not mislead the reader? I wrote the text of my book four years ago [in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions - my dialogue]. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet [famous fossil expert stephen J.] Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least "show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived". I will lay it on teh line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument."
Patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos, and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively. However, the language is clear and unmistakable. 
Stephen Jay Gould, evolutionist said this: "The lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology". All quotes came from "The Revised Quote Book". You interestingly bring up human evolution. Human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the Titanic. Let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates:
* Australopithecines (Lucy fossil type):- Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis (an objective method that does not  depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry), do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors. He states that although initally it was though that they were human-like or at least intermediate between apes and humans, the reality is that they "differ more from both humans and African apes than do these two living groups from each other. THe australopithecines are unique." Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not  habitually walk upright, as many still insist. 
* Homo Habblis:- Many scientists (evolutionary scientists included) are now recognising that Habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures, and hence, is an invalid category. Even so, the CAT scans have determined that Habblis was less  bipedal than Australopithecines. So we are actually "de-evolving" if you will. 
* Homo Erectus and Neandertals:- Once again, CAT scans have shown that Erectus and Neandertals walked up right just like us. They would be able to run,hop, skip, jump, etc, and do all the things that we do today. Many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as "true humans". And it has been known that Neandertal types had been living at the same time as "modern" types. Tools found on an Indonesian island in associatino with stegodon (an extinct elephant) remains have cause evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these so-called "pre-human ancestors" had seafaring skills and technology. As far back as 1993 he said, "They're not [i.e. shouldn't be called] Homo erecus, they're people". This quote came from the Australian, 19 August 1993.
If one uses the evolutionists' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all "hominid" fossil discoveries on a chart, it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles. (M. Lubenow, "Bones of Contention").
I found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins.com. They totally do not know what they are talking about. In one article that I saw regarding SNRs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory, as for one, the article was not written by an educated person, nor did it have any references - unlike the article on SNRs that was written by Answers in Genesis. Many of their arguments, like the one on your link can be easliy refuted. Other articles employ what is known as the "straw man" argument tactic, i.e. using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone. 
If evolution is true, than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in-between forms, right? Well, the truth is, we don't. Some evolutionists claim there are some - maybe a handful - of such in-between fossil types (highly, highly, highly debatable). Other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these. What is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx, often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for "transitional" status. The feathers are fully formed, and the wings are proper wings. It has the backward-facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds. It wasmost definitely not, as some would reconstruct it, a running feathered dinosaur. 
In fact, the same can be shown to be true for whale evolution animals such as the Ambulocetus and the Basilosaurs. These are not evolutionary transitional forms, as you are often told. Many evolutionists do not even acknowledge them, but this does not mean that they don't believe in their theory.
So in this respect, the fossil record does not show evolution as you are commonly told. In fact, it tells us that things breed true to their kind, i.e. horses produce horses, cats produce cats and so on.
You than go onto challange:
