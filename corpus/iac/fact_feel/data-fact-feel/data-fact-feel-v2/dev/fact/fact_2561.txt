Quite false.
The fossil record shows that life started as "simple" single-celled life - bacteria - about 3.5 billion years ago. More complex multicellular life did not appear in the fossil record for nearly 2.5 billion years. And then what we find are only very simple multicellular life forms, such as the simple bilaterian Vernanimalcula about 580 to 600 million years ago. A few million years later in the fossil record we find more complex organisms, like trilobites, but nothing complex like a reptile, bird, or mammal. Later we find jawless fishes making their appearance, followed by jawed fishes, then amphibians, then reptiles, then transitional forms leading from reptiles to mammals, then primates, and then humans.
