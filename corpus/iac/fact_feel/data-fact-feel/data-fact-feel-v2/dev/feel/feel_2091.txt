Does this mean that I can use the terms "fetus" and "baby" interchangeably? Like can I say, "I need to find a fetus sitter so I can go out to the movies with my friends."
When I go car seat shopping, can I ask for "a seat to put my fetus in?"
Or when I'm in a child's clothing store, can I ask for fetus clothes?
