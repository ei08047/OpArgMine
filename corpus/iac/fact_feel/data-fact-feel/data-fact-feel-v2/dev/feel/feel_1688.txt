Actually you support "my choice" not. - For you see, your choice of the word BUT negates your words preceding it, 
for one.
For two, your own lack-of-understanding is causing you to feel 
"disgust me, because I'm pretty sure" <-- what you said here, confirms the above. And 
Telling & transparent is: "So you saying "God" is against abortion, is the same as me saying "God" wants me to kill non-believers and adulterers."
Annie: only by your twisted arguments. Your entire post here, is built on one false manipulation after another. And after you managed to get yourself into this fix, no wonder the above non-sense is the best you can come up with.
