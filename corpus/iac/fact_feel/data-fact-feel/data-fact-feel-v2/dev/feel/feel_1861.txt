So what if a bunch of rich lobbiest got together and found a way to overturn that? Do you think they should be allowed to do that? What if they said that because of organ donor shortages that now it would be law in your state that when you die, all of your organs would be taken out and reused without your permission. Would that be OK for them to do?
