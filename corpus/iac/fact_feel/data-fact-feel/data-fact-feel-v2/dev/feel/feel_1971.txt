Yet, consistently, when asked to justify your position, you, and others, have seen fit to use locker rooms as justification. If all these bad analogies are not justification, then what is your justifcation? Please tell us, since I obviously chose the wrong response of yours. This isn't some hypothetical issue. We're talking about human rights, people, living breathing adults with families, friends, looking forward to a new year, where.....where people like you BLINDLY declare them sinners, immoral, partaking in evil, and ultimately, not allowed to form legal parternships the same why hetero couples are based on.....based on....based on......
On what? Your desire to oppress the minority? Your desire to push your specific religion onto other people? What? They are reading this forum right now, wondering why you choose to oppress them. Please tell us.
On the flip-side, you seem to also have the time to insult me, how kind of you.
