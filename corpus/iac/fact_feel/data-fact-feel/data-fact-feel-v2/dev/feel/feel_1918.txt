Well, the simplest explanation often proves to be correct. I could give you examples, but I'm not sure you would pay attention.
Just to show I'm not bluffing: if you typed a paper while sleepy, went to bed, and woke up only to find errors in your paper, the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes, rather than that a hacker put them there. I expect that most times, there was no hacker. The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct.
However, having all the information is important. If you later find out that a computer genius was submitting a paper to a contest that you were submitting yours to and that most of the other papers involved had many errors, the likelyhood of a hacker goes up.
Yes, I know that was a weird example. I only used it because there is someone who actually believes (according to rinkworks.com) that a hacker messes with her writing.
