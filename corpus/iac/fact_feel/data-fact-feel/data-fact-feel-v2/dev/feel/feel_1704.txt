LOL. Well that's so nice of the copy who let you know. And that's very interesting -- "every time" -- Archangel. How many times have you been stopped? And for going how fast? I'm sure it was a lot more than 35 mph!
And you have the nerve to talk about "responsibility" or how this woman was a jerk?
Or to call me names?
Dearest, I never speed because I take my responsibilities as a citizen so seriously, and i have never received a speeding ticket.
Were you driving under the influence as well?
How many lives did you put at risk, Archangel?
What pomposity! What hypocrisy!
