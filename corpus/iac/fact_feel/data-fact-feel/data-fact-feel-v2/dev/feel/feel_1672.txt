Way to disprove the virgin birth, IMRAHIL. Of course neither the virgin birth story or the creation story are true. If a similar occurance were to happen today, the same ppl who believe it could have happened in antiquity would consider it ridiculous, and scrutinize the occurance to a degree they would never question their dogma.
