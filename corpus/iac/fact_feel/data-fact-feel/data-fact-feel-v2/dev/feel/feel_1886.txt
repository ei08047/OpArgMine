I think you're over-complicating the anti-choice position. A majority of anti-choice posts I've read are essentially based on their 2000 year-old mythical belief system, when women were not considered a particularly valuable portion of society for tasks other than child bearing and scullery purposes. Unless, of course, capable of immaculate conception, still unproven, yet enjoying dogmatic status. If you refute those mythical beliefs, regardless of any country's constitution, to those posters you're actually less than a piece of real estate and definitely non-human, male or female.
