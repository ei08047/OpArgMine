Well, then we get into the sticky area of 'what exactly is a right' and 'where do they come from'.
Personally, I believe that a right is simply a type of behaviour that is socially permissable. It doesn't have to be encouraged or enjoyed, it just has to be tolerated. Now, there is a difference between what rights people actually have, and what rights you think people should have. They don't have to come from some outdated and irrelevant constitution, and certainly aren't granted by any mythical god.
