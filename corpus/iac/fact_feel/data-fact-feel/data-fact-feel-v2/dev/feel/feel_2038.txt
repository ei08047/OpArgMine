It is abrasive to think that republican's are republican's souly for the fact of abortion rights or non right's however you want to put it. My father is a republican, i am a democrat and always will be. My father believes in abortion and he is a republican so your theory is so far wrong from beginning to end. Either way you look at it, Republican's have unsuccesfully pulled the abortion rights from american women so it really doesn't matter.
