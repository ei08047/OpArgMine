Until you have chosen to stand in uniform between the criminal element and the law abiding in our communities; until you have felt the anguish of attending a funeral service for a fallen brother, until you have felt the helplessness and shed tears resulting from an inability to prevent someone from seeing harm; until you have stood upon our streets and offered service in defense against those that would seek to do others harm; you have no ground on which to stand in making such comments!!!
Law enforcement, as a whole, exhibits a love of community that few can even comprehend. Every day we place ourselves in harms way, in the hope that we can prevent some of the evil that lurks in our world. We do this by choice. No one has forced us into this position. We do this because we are of a breed that is able and willing to fight in the face of evil. We do this knowing that it is unlikely that we will win this war, but that it is the fight which matters. 
Our reward for such service?? Last year, my net income was a little over $42,000. We are constantly berated by a public that has no real comprehension of what we struggle with on a daily basis. We are often held in contempt by many, for life and death decisions we make in a split second with little or unreliable information. Our families are often victims of the stresses created by our chosen profession. I have encountered grief over the evils of man that you and many others have no way of even imagining.DO NOT sit safely behind your keyboard, and pretend that you have some insight into what we think and feel, until you are prepared to stand where I have stood for the past twelve years.
