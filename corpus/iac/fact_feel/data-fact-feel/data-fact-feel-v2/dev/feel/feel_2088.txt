Oh OK, I get it!
It’s not being gay that is a sin; it’s the gay sex that is a sin.
You are such an expert on gay people!
How about this EZ, what if two gay men live together, love each other, sleep in separate beds, never have sex but maybe give each other a little French kiss now and then?
Is that OK, EZ?
Here let me answer that question for you since your famous for avoiding the issue.
Why yes Mr. Monster that is perfectly fine and a totally realistic thing to ask people to do!
I know why you’re avoiding answering the topic question directly.
Believe me I am going to rip you a new one regardless (figuratively speaking.)
You may as well let it all out.
You know you want to.
So go ahead, make my day.
