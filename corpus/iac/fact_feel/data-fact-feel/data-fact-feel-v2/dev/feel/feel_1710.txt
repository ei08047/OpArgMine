Is George Mason some kind of anarchist?
It seems to me that the por-gun people are more and more pushing towards the 'every man for himself, the government can´t protect us, we have to defend our property and way of life'. Shouldn´t the government be improved instead?
Besides, where I live we have very restrictive gun-laws and I´ve never feeled 'enslaved' in any way.
Ok, a comment to these 'myths'.
First of all, where did you get these facts?
Second of all, no matter how you try, now matter how much statistics you dig forth, no matter how many references to the constitution you do, you can never, ever convince me that harsh gun-restrictions would not reduce the amount of murders and the amount of armed crime.
Besides, all people doesn´t share your attitude of: a good criminal is a dead criminal, so those arguments get a bit meaningless.
