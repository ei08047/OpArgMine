Why don't you take your own advice?
What would it take to change YOUR mind on abortion?
BTW, this, 'I said. "I'll chain you to the bed before I let you kill our child."' from your post #1 in this thread clearly indicates your true attitude.
What kind of a man would chain a pregnant woman to a bed for the duration of a pregnancy?
Now, while you are asking others what would change their minds, the question of what it would take to change YOURS looms ever larger.
