Oh so I take it the drug dealer was a law abiding citizen who had obtained his firearm legally and used the shotgun in self defence? I though not. Just out of personal interest lets say you took away the rights of the law abiding to own guns how would that shooting be stopped, cus i am pretty sure the drug dealing criminal would still get his gun Illegally. 
A gunner you say went on a massacre? I am pretty sure you mean a criminal went on a massacre and maybe if somebody like Doc or Old sarge was there the end death tally would have been alot different.
