No I won't walk into that situation. What you feel to be right is OK with me. It is what you feel to be right and try to make it public policy is what I disagree with.
You should fear yourself. YOU are a greater danger to yourself than a felon with a firearm. You have an extremely skewed sense of risk assement. I don't expect to change your mind, after all I don't expect to convince someone with an irrational fear of flying that it is safe.
Want to kill yourself? Sucide? That is very irrational isn't it?
