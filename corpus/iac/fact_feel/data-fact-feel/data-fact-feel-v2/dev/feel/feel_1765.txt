Your love of assumption is quite amusing (it also highlights your inability to argue honestly). All I did was point out that accidents are a cause of injuries and fatalities dealing with firearms. Nowhere did I suggest banning them in the slightest. Furthermore, I specifically noted that most of the accidents were due to improper gun safety. 
So how about you take the stick out of your XXX and stop assuming whatever the **** you want for a change? 
You are a joke Isly. About time you admit it.
