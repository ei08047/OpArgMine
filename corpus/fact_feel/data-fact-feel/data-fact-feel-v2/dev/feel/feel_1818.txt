You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?
How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. 
Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?
The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly.
