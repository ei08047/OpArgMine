You are not only rude but incorrect in calling sinjin an idiot. His opinion is just as valid as yours. He is quite far from idiocy.
I percieve his point to be that you do not have a right to endanger the lives of others by engaging in a firefight with some perps who may not have fired if you hadn't shown up playing Sheriff. While we have not yet perfected a method of reliably predicting exactly what some perp will do if left in control with a gun in his hand in a crowded mall, we can assume that more harm will come if he is not taken down and disarmed. The fact that a citizen may legally have a gun in his pocket capable of knocking down a large animal rather than a pea-shooter that will only make it mad is comforting to me. I like big guns, too.
I can agree somewhat with the idea of hesitating to interfere when an altercation seems imminent, but I cannot agree that armed citizens should never "endanger the lives of others" by pulling his piece and firing at the perp.
By the way, when you quote someone you should use their exact words, not your version of what they said...and you should apologize to sinjin for calling him an idiot.
