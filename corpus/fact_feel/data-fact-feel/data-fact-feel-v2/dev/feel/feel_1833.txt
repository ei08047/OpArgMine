Why do you want to approach in language of least-value of human life by reducing it in comparison to such things as a 'tumor'? Obviously a tumor is different simply on the basis that it won't be growing into a child and an adult soon (actually, never!). Why should the fact that something is going to soon grow into a child, adolescent, and adult not factor into whether or not life is valued? Is the pro-choice position so weak that what is growing inside the mother has to be described in terms of a 'tumor'? Jo is right--and yes, AA; you shouldn't have to not value human life just to have the pro-choice position. This attitude of reducing that which will soon grow into a person to the likes of a tumor is the very sort of thing validates some of the complaints pro-lifers sometimes make about the pro-choice movement. Why can you not be pro-choice AND value life?
