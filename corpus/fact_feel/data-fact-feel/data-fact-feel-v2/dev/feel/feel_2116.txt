For all we know if the kids in the classroom had guns then this never would've happened because the shooter would've known that he'd be met with a hail of bullets the second he brought out his own guns.
This kind of #### is what everybody says will happen, but it never does! Everybody seems to think that it's best the nobody but the shooter is armed because that'll somehow yield less deaths than somebody being able to kill the school shooter.
