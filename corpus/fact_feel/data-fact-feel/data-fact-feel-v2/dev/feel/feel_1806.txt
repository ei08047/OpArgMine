Are you too blind and hypocritical to appreciate that your attempts to impose your amoral and unethical world view on we traditional moralists via the legislative activism you participate in, is doing precisely what you are accusing me of doing? Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you? 
And why do you people constantly assert how tolerant you are and how intolerant we are when you have absolutely no tolerance for our position regarding the immoral and perverse lifestyle you defend? Where is my right to disagree with you secular humanists whose immorality has led us down the slippery slope of social chaos our society finds itself in today? Here's one example of what I mean.
What is a "rainbow party"?
I overheard my daughter saying she is going to attend another one. Is this something I should be concerned about?

The girls wear different colored lipstick and take turns performing oral sex on the boys -- leaving a rainbow of colors on the the boys' private parts.
Watch the movie "Thirteen" (Thirteen (2003) ) and get more involved in the life of your daughter (and other kids if you have any)! There is no pleading ignorance on this one... this information is readily out there, and has been for a few years. 
Children only learn what they are taught, so it is up to us, the parents, to be actively involved in their lives AND to be aware of what's in the popular culture that they are learning from their peers and the media.

This is the result of your secular humanist pop culture which has completely secularized our society and has attempted to erase God and any recognition of his values from our society over the past 50 years. But what is most sad is that you will respond with the opinion that we don't even have a problem at all. You are completely void of the ability to recognize that we have lost our way morally speaking as a people, and are running to destruction with our fingers in our ears as a civilization. 
We traditionalists understand very well that we either rise or fall together as a people which is why we still oppose what you represent. But we don't do it to oppress you at all, we do it to preserve our Nation because God will surely lift His hand from protecting us as we abandon Him and His values which you humanists have worked so hard to erase. But alas, I waste my time even attempting to reason with a spiritually dead secular humanist who has nothing more to respond with but excuses and shallow justifications for your world view! emoticonXRolleyes
