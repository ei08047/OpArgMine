Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**
The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.
I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.
*You mean 'understanding' written English.
**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.
Thank you, come again.
