So as a conservative...you believe in having someone else decide for you what kind of sex you can have in the privacy of your home? Wow, maybe I'm not conservative after all. Some Jews think pork is disgusting...would you support them banning you from eating pork? I'm not saying you can't think what you want about whatever you want (I personally think drinking blood and eating dead flesh is creepy but would never attempt to enjoin a christian from doing so)...but you cross the line when you attempt to deny someone liberty when it doesn't effect you.
