It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.
Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.
Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?
