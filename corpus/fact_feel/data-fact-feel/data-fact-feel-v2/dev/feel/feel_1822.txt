Oh, so God's design prowess is comparable to that of we mere humans? He's no more intelligent than us? I thought God was supposed to be all knowing, but I guess you've just shown that to not be the case.
You also miss the fact that we KNOW FOR A FACT that internal combustion engines are designed by humans, and that we KNOW FOR A FACT that they could not arise without us. On the other hand, we do NOT KNOW that humans were designed by God and we do NOT KNOW that humans could not arise without Him. In fact, we have considerable evidence to the contrary: that humans evolved from a common ancestor we share with chimps. Engines don't reproduce; life does. Engines don't undergo biological evolution; life does.
Your analogy is flawed, in multiple ways.
