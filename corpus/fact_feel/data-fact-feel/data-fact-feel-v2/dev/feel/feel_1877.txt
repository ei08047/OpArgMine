I will answer the remainder later as I am pressed for time. Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form. It has well defined feathers. Where is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution. Natural selection in particular but overall evolution. 
If you read Gould's original work he does not say what he says above and in fact actually contradicts it. It appears like a response that is back peddling at best. 
As I said, more later.
