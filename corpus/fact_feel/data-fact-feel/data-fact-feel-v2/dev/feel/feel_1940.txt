While I don't appreciate your tone, you are correct in that I misunderstood the premise of this thread.
The short answer is that I would have to be convinced that a soul exists and that a soul is injected at any point in the process of conception through labor. An unlikely situation given that I'm an agnostic.
Though I have said that I'm amendable to banning 3'rd trimester abortions as a compromise. Loosely related to having my mind changed.
