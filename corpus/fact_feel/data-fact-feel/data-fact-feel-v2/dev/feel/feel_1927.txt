Probably not. Very rarely do I run into a anti-abortionist who actually has a viable plan for decreasing what they protest. In fact some of the most ardent anti-abortion people I've met are also some of the most ardent anti-comprehensive sexual education people as well. It's like banning an action without trying to resolve why it happens in the first place.
