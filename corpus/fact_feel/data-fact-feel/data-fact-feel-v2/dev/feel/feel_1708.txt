Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? Much less can science offer "proof" of evolution by means of organ transplants. The idea is simple minded at best.
since it seems to be important to you, why don't you offer "proof" that evolution doen't happen. Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread.
