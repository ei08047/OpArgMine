For someone who believes the following: "One cannot/should not/ought not to force their own personal moral beliefs onto others," it is indeed ridiculous to try and tell somone else: "You cannot/should not/ought not to force your own personal morals on people." To do so would be to force a personal moral belief onto somone else, which would render the statement absurd.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean when you say "the whole moral thing," but I doubt it breaks down. Because there are people who hold the position that one can force morality onto someone else, even if only in certain circumstances, it is the case that somebody's moral belief(s) will be forced onto someone else.
