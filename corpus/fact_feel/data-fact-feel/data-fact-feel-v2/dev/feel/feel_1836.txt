I believe Jesus is a role model for the human race. I believe he is a very powerful idea. But what I do NOT believe is that there was some dude with a beard running around Israel healing the blind and preaching about his God. So, in a sense, I don't believe Jesus was a literal person in the ancient world, but more of a fable. Like Harry Potter is today.
