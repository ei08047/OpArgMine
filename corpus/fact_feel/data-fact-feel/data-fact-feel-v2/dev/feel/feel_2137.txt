Well, it also deprives that person of rethinking their life, and maybe become a missionary for children in Afirca or something. You cannot judge a man's life on what he has done, you can judge him about those acts, but not his entire life.
The death penalty is a contradictory measure. On one side, we say we want to protect the value of human life by putting murderers in jail, but on the other, we show utter contempt for that same value. How can you say you are protecting the life of your citizens (because you value it), while at the same time you end someone else's life. This is absurd.
