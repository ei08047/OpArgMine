A woman can think was she wants but it is still a human being. Killing parasites was often the argument for eugenics ya know...a parasite on society...just thought I'd let that slip.
Nevertheless, I think the woman should have the choice..and she does. However, if she makes the choice to kill another human being we should punish her or whoever did it.
