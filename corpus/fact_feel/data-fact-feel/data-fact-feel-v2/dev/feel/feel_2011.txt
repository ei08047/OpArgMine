Good has nothing do with logic. Explain what good and logic have in common????
The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God. 
God is transcendent; that is, He is beyond the material universe being its creator. 
God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature. 
Therefore, the laws of logic are absolute. 
The are absolute because there is an absolute God. 
The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes, and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue.
