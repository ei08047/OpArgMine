Nope a true believer will insist on his belief system even in the presense of overwheliming contrary evidence. So far you have not managed to produce andy such evidence to the contrary. Should you do so in a rational scientific way which can be verified then Darwinists will throw down the theory and join you in your conclusions with verve. I am not however going to wait for it to happen. Tis up to you.
