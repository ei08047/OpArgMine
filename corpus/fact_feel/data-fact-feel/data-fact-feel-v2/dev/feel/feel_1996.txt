But only in a good cause - which is defined as putting money into the pockets of friends of the Bush dynasty. Registering gays in DC is not going to do that. Nor will a lot of other worthy programs. On the other hand tearing down a country with one hand while rebuilding it with the other and paying for both ones own armaments and those of the "enemy" manages the job nicely. And after all "the right people" will come out ahead since they can hire all the cheap servants they want.
