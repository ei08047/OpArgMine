You are just plain pathetic in your pursuit of dishonest argument on behalf of the health insurance industry.
They were not insured, they could not get in for treatment without insurance, both were preventable deaths, costs were unbelievable, and you know it.
You couldn't care less about that mother and unborn child. You don't care about any unborn children.
You worship the Almighty Dollar. That's all.
You are politically finished in this country and you know it. Everyone is sick and tired of the lies and greed of your ilk. Your Demon Ship is sinking fast and you know it.
