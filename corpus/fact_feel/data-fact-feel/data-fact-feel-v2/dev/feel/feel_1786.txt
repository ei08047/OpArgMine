What is your non-violent way of stopping a felon with a knife? A felon who at 30 has spent 10 years in prison and was raped by other prisoners?
I suspect you will do what most New Yorkers will do when they witness a crime: NOT GET INVOLVED!
I will stop carrying a pistol when life is rosy. What else do you do to protect yourself besides being concerned?
