I know, it fell from the sky, didnt it?
No, ok, then it swam ashore, no?
I know how about GOD created it, hold on, how did god come about?
Hmmmmmm, maybe it just appeared, or even better, scottie beamed it down, thats sounds good.
But i got an even better one, some clever scientist boffin built a time machine and sent one back in time, thats it.
Any other ideas?
