Well again, this is not what the Bible claims of itself.
2Ti 3:16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 
17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. 
In fact, Jesus himself quotes Genesis as though it were literal history (cf. Genesis 2:24 and Matthew 19:4, 5). Additionally, Jesus himself said that he was subject to the Old Testament:
Matthew 5:17 Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.
The "law and the prophets" are a common reference for "scripture" or the Old Testament. Either the Bible is what it claims to be, or it is not. If it is not what it claims to be, then how can we possibly trust that Jesus was who he claimed to be? The two concepts are directly tied together.
