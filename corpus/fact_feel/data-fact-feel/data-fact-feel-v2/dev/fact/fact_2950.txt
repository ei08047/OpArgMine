See, here is the example of how..out of touch you are. Of course it could be dangerous. I have not only been gay bashed once, but twice in my life. The first time coming out of a bar when I was in my early 20s. I was beaten by five guys with baseball bats. My head swelled 3 times it's size and I was out cold for 4 days. I had "nike" imprinted into my skin from the bottom of their sneakers.
The second time, I met a friend for dinner at a local bar. We met at about 7pm, had a drink and as we left the bar to go to a diner I was body slammed by two college kids running down the street. Broke my collar bone and was knocked out. When the owner of the bar came out he asked...do you think this was a hate crime. We have been having some problems. 
The world is not a safe place for gays and lesbians. We never know when we will be someplace where we could be assulted. 
You, jyoshu, live in dreamland when it comes to gays and lesbians. That has been shown to those of us here in the board a thousand times over. YOu understand so little of what being gay is about.
