Yes because it is "officially" a life.
Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.
If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.
If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.
So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option.
