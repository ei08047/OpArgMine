21st Century cause and effect is not something those desiring adhesion to 2000-year mythical belief systems are prepared to accept. As a current example displaying what will happen with outlawing abortion, I offer over-the-counter cough medicine used as a ingredient in cooking crystal meth, the (US) current street drug of choice. Sales of that simple ingredient were banned in my state by politicians claiming it would 'dry up' meth production. No support whatsoever from LE due to the simple fact that cheap finished product from Canada and Mexico would simply flood the market, eliminating the need for local production, expand usage by increased availability and fill up our jails with the aftermath of crimes against property and people. Guess what? That's exactly what's happening. Christian morality regarding abortion and drugs might be the predominate factor in many of our criminal statutes, but there's certainly no doubt it's a cost we can no longer afford on a social or financial basis.
