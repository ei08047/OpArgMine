So then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters, how we got here? If you concede that then I'm happy to end this discussion. I recall, however, visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life. Evolutionary theory does address origins and its explanations are unsuppported by evidence.
