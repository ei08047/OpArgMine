Oh dear.
Do you actually know what a scientist means when they call something a "theory"? Because it seems to me that you do not. The concept of gravity is "only a theory", yet oddly enough I don't see anyone trying to say that we should stop accepting the existence of the force of gravity because of this. 
The SCIENTIFIC theory of Evolution is a scientific theory that has been and continues to be extensively researched and developed. It should be taught in schools.
Creationism (or Intelligent Design) is not a scientific theory, and is not supported by any evidence. If it must be allowed into schools at all it should be confined to the religious studies classroom, not the science laboratory.
