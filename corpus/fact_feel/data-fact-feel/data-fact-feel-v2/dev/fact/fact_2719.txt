Just this morning there was an article in the paper about a woman in the Extreme Southern part of Texas in Brownsville being shot "with a stray bullet from Mexican soldiers" on our side of the river. Over 80% of the crimes are committed by Mexican gang members, many of which are ex-soldiers and drug enforcement for the mafias.
Nope, not safe at all when foreign invaders attack Texans on our side of the river and do pseudo cop break and enters of homes or robbery of businesses.
That is a good example of the importance of being armed. One county sheriff along the river encouraged citizens to get armed just for that purpose, freely admitting that his officers will not be there when they are needed the most. We Texans have kidnapping and ransome too but reserve our right to protect ourselves unlike EuroAsia who has copitulated entirely.
You were saying?
