That definition isn't what I'm disagreeing with :) I'm just pointing out why it's not happening here.
Retroviruses, as I said, open up some very interesting possibilities. I'm not aware of any conclusive research taking place - I know the immune system makes use of them but I don't think there's any evidence of immunity being passed down in that way: early mothers' milk is the mechanism for that (packed with a payload of antibodies to prime the infant's immune system).
To be honest, I think the existence of that system rather stomps on the plausibility of Lamarckian inheritance; why bother going to all that trouble if the parent could simply code immunity into the genes it passes to its offspring?
