The ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and Constitutionally weak ground that Congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years. It expires this year.
The right to own arms is expressly clear. It shall not be infringed by Congress. The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons, it does not have the power to limit them from citizens.
Those people who "you don't know (what they may do)"? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so, then we no longer live in a free society. Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law. It cuts both ways, you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free. The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police. The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall "back in the day" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police. The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy, you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again.
The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.
The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.
Some points I have for you:
1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.
Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:
"Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy." - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm
Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.
2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:

The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.
So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.
3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.
4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target. Well then, if you rifle is semi-auto, then what reason is there to ban them?
