Shotguns are used for hunting.
BB guns aren't useful when robbing a store as they're too 'weak'.
I see no legal use handguns can fulfil, although I'm fairly neutral on banning them, if the country is already saturated with them. I don't see what it's going to achieve; the people who will mis-use the guns already have them. If there were no handguns in Canada I would support the ban, but as presumably there are already lots, I don't think the ban's a great idea.
