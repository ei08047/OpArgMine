Actually, there is. The naturalistic explanation is the only viable theory put forth. Out of all the other crackpot theories (they really aren't theories), this as well as later evolution are the only parsimonious ones.
You use occam's razor to select the most parsimonious theory out of competing theories. You look at them and see which ones attempt to explain the same phenomenon, and then look to see how they do it. WHich ones assume something outside of nature? Paranomal? GOD! Not the naturalistic common ancestor/primoridal soup. THat's fully plausible, and natural.
And natural selection isn't nebulous. Your ignornance of the subject obfuscates that judgement. It's been observed and there is more than adequate evidence for the vast majority of scientists.
