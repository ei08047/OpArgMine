I see. So you must be a female to know for a fact that this is false. Actually I'm not interested in that kind of science and I don't care. I haven't seen the papers but I suspect the book was written for mercenary reasons. What does that have to do with cosmology, physics, astrophysics, geology, molecular biology, genetics and on and on? Someone mentioned that you seem to mistrust science and it seems that you do.
