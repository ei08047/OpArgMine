ah, but why do you use the word concept for both evolution and intelligent design? Evolution is a theory that has been studied, given evidence, and offered up for peer review. Intelligent design is simply a concept, a single belief. Evolution is a theory that can be backed up and the world can benefit from it. How can the world benefit from a simple statement that there is an intelligent designer. This has absolutely no application to the natural world today.
