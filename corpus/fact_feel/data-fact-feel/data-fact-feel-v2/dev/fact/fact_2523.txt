And SS's hypothesis is demonstrably false. Humans are one of the least genetically diverse organisms, and yet, there is an average of 14 alleles for every gene in the human population. Any two people can, at most, carry 4 alleles for any given gene.
Even if we consider a very simple and famous example, the peppered moth (Biston betularia), we find that the color is determined by a single gene of which there are 5 known alleles.
And then there is the great variety in domestic dogs. Although there is little doubt that our dogs are descended from wolves from somewhere in Asia, there are many, many alleles that do not exist in any population of wolves. Some breeds are the result of known mutations.
