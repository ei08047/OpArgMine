You really have a strange definition of faith.
Scientific laws require reproducible results (patterns).
That's how they got to be laws.
I believe that the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth will have the same value tomorrow that it had yesterday because there is no indication that this pattern will change.
It's not because of faith, or at least certainly not due to the kind of faith required to believe in the supernatural. 
Your definition of faith sounds like an exercise in solipsim.
I can't prove you are a human and not a computer so I have to have faith that you really are a human (despite all the patterns I have built up in my brain over time.)
