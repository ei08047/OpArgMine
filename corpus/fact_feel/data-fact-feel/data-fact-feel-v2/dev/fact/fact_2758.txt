We're all addicted to something. 
I had a tough time recently giving up coffee.
It was interfering with my life. 
It was making me feel like XXXX, I couldn't sleep right, my bowels were out of whack, but I couldn't just stop cold turkey. I tried, but I got these really bad headaches and my whole body felt like XXX. It was hell at work, my head felt like it was going to explode and I was achy all the time. I had to gradually wean myself from it. Now I drink tea which has less caffiene but I still sometimes feel like I have to have it. Since I've cut down (I don't think I've really gotten totally over my caffiene addiction)I fell so much better. I have more energy during the day, I don't wake up half dead desperately needing a quad espresso.
