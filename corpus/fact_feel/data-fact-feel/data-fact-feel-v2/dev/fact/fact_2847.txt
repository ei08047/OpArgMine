As to your first point, as far as I can tell, you looked at the world and said, "Naw, there's no way this happened without God." And not just any God, but Trinity father son holy spirit God. The miraculous creation of our existance does not point to Christianity at all. However, you didn't just look at the 'miraculous creation,' no you had a study guide. Allow me to mention something right here, and point out I'm a Methodist....ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue, but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it. Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God. The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance, it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions.
As to your second point, argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you haven't really put much thought into this contention. You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school. There is a good reason for this. I can't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." 
This means government isn't suppose to support religious groups. What would you define mandatory school prayer as? Anyone who has ever argued that a seperation between church and state isn't a good thing has obviously never been the religious minority. I lived in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and I can tell you state supported religion is not good.
