I seem to take a different approach to this objection than most people. The principle of NS is so painfully obvious that I have trouble understanding why people have trouble understanding it. For this reason, I can see how it does sometimes come across as tautologous. Two plus two may be four because we've defined two and four that way, but that doesn't make the equation untrue. Likewise, that those genes that help animals be better able to pass on their genes will be passed on more often (due to whatever specifics) is true regardless of objection. Whatever works, works. Those mosquitoes that aren't drawn to the zapper live; those that are die. Those animals that can withstand the frigid winter live; those that can't freeze. Why is this so hard to understand?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the objection?
