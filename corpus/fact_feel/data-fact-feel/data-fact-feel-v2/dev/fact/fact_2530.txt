You are probably using the NIV version of the Bible. It is not the most accurate version because some of the meaning was lost in the translation. Here is the NASB version (much closer to the original meaning): 1 Chronicles 16:30 "Tremble before Him, all the earth; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved." "will"= future tense. The earth itself is moving (rotating, orbiting the sun, etc.), but it "will not be moved" by something else.
