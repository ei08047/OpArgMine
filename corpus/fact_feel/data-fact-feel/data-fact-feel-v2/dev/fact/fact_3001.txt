You mean like showing what the Scientific Method is, and why this invalidates all creationists claims of doing science as outright lies? Do you want me to elaborate on that?
Or did you mean the challenge of the creationist lie of "adaptation" not being Evolution? Do you want me to elaborate on that?
Or the inane claim by bertvan that living systems all can react intelligently to stimuli (f.ex. I wonder how you think lichen react to stimuli with intelligence?) Is that what you wanted me to elaborate on?
What part of the ####, nonsense and lies that bertvan spewed is it that you want me to elaborate on? 
Or did you want me to elaborate on some of the falsehoods and lies of yours that I have challenged? Are you actually up to dealing with challenges to your spewed falsehoods, or will you run from that?
