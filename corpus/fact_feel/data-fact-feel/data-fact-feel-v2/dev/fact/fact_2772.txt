I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that you think that theropod dinosaurs should have more feathers than this Sinornithosaurus does? First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless, and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless, and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers, you are surprised that there are not more.
I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil.

But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did, in fact exist. Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot. It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless. Obviously they were not.
So now we return to your original confused and erroneous arguments.
