Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. 
What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable.
