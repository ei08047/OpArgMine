Oh wow. Apparently your experience on the internet is quite shallow. 
To people who have used the internet over a significant period of time, we recognize that the blue text are often links. Moving one's cursor over the blue text changes one cursor further proving that the text is just not colored. 
In iangb's most recent post there are several links. That handle has labeled them 1, 2, 3 and 4. They are different color then the rest of the text and they are underlined. Generally links on forums are denoted that way. Upon clicking one of those links, as clicking is how links are open in internet browsers, either a new window or tab will appear with that page displayed. 
Two of the links have the full document. If you look at the far right side, you'll notice a icon that says "Free full text article." That too is a link. In that web page, you'll see a page divider that is labeled "Full Text" and there is a pdf which stands for "portable document format." Within that PDF is the full text. You may need to go to Adobe to download their free reader to read it. 
The links all initially go to a web page database. Databases often include large amounts of primary source data. A primary source is one of original context, such as a scientific study, a drug test finding, a study of a historical event from a contemporary perspective by someone who lived through it.
