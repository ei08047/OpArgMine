Oh God, not again. You're correct in the fact that the fossil record doesn't prove evolution. Fossils, being the lithified remains of long dead organisms, have great problems providing any evidence on thier genetic make-up. What the fossil record does show is cases where, over time, modifications can be seen in animals morphology. There is also the fact you can find animals which are 'almost' another type of animal. A good example is Synapsids (otherwise known as 'Mammal-like reptiles'). The fossil record provides data which is best explained by the ToE, rather than 'Goddidit'. The argument between ToE and ID is not something in which the fossil record can be involved.
As far as I can tell, you don't talk about God as the personalised deity that most mainstream christian traditions talk about. In fact you seem to have a rather 'hippy-ish' view in that God is an energy. Just so you know, the idea that humans die when seeing Gods goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Zeus killed one of his lovers when she demanded to see him in his true form (just by the power revealed in him). I think she was the mother of Perseus or something....
Just so you know, if God is a force, we've probably already picked him out and got him down as an unexplained physical constant, and if he's a spirit, we can't pick him up scientifically, and therefore aren't trying to prove him or disprove him. It's true that we are not hugely advanced in terms of our understanding, but we are hugely advanced beyond 5-600 years ago, when the christians were doing thier best to burn anyone who asked questions. Nowadays we agree that Gallileo was a very smart man, rather than a heretic. Religion still has a place today, but it no longer directs the entire course of human life.
