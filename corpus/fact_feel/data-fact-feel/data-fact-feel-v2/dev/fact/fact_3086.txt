Pregnancy is ALWAYS physically harmful. You try carrying a load of extra weight about and see what that does to your heart. It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go.
These are the normal, frequent or expectable temporary side effects of pregnancy: 
-- exhaustion (weariness common from first weeks) 
-- altered appetite and senses of taste and smell 
-- nausea and vomiting (50% of women, first trimester) 
-- heartburn and indigestion 
-- constipation 
-- weight gain 
-- dizziness and light-headedness 
-- bloating, swelling, fluid retention 
-- hemmorhoids 
-- abdominal cramps 
-- yeast infections 
-- congested, bloody nose 
-- acne and mild skin disorders 
-- skin discoloration (chloasma, face and abdomen) 
-- mild to severe backache and strain 
-- increased headaches 
-- difficulty sleeping, and discomfort while sleeping 
-- increased urination and incontinence 
-- bleeding gums 
-- pica 
-- breast pain and discharge 
-- swelling of joints, leg cramps, joint pain 
-- difficulty sitting, standing in later pregnancy 
-- inability to take regular medications 
-- shortness of breath 
-- higher blood pressure 
-- hair loss 
-- tendency to anemia 
-- curtailment of ability to participate in some sports and activities 
-- infection including from serious and potentially fatal disease (pregnant women are immune suppressed compared with non-pregnant women, and are more susceptible to fungal and certain other diseases) 
-- extreme pain on delivery 
-- hormonal mood changes, including normal post-partum depression 
-- continued post-partum exhaustion and recovery period (exacerbated if a c-section -- major surgery -- is required, sometimes taking up to a full year to fully recover) 
These are the normal, expectable, or frequent PERMANENT side effects of pregnancy: 
-- stretch marks (worse in younger women) 
-- loose skin 
-- permanent weight gain or redistribution 
-- abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness 
-- pelvic floor disorder (occurring in as many as 35% of middle-aged former child-bearers and 50% of elderly former child-bearers, associated with urinary and rectal incontinence, discomfort and reduced quality of life) 
-- changes to breasts 
-- varicose veins 
-- scarring from episiotomy or c-section 
-- other permanent aesthetic changes to the body (all of these are downplayed by women, because the culture values youth and beauty) 
-- increased proclivity for hemmorhoids 
-- loss of dental and bone calcium (cavities and osteoporosis) 
These are the occasional complications and side effects: 
-- hyperemesis gravidarum 
-- temporary and permanent injury to back 
-- severe scarring requiring later surgery (especially after additional pregnancies) 
-- dropped (prolapsed) uterus (especially after additional pregnancies, and other pelvic floor weaknesses -- 11% of women, including cystocele, rectocele, and enterocele) 
-- pre-eclampsia (edema and hypertension, the most common complication of pregnancy, associated with eclampsia, and affecting 7 - 10% of pregnancies) 
-- eclampsia (convulsions, coma during pregnancy or labor, high risk of death) 
-- gestational diabetes 
-- placenta previa 
-- anemia (which can be life-threatening) 
-- thrombocytopenic purpura 
-- severe cramping 
-- embolism (blood clots) 
-- medical disability requiring full bed rest (frequently ordered during part of many pregnancies varying from days to months for health of either mother or baby) 
-- diastasis recti, also torn abdominal muscles 
-- mitral valve stenosis (most common cardiac complication) 
-- serious infection and disease (e.g. increased risk of tuberculosis) 
-- hormonal imbalance 
-- ectopic pregnancy (risk of death) 
-- broken bones (ribcage, "tail bone") 
-- hemorrhage and 
-- numerous other complications of delivery 
-- refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease 
-- aggravation of pre-pregnancy diseases and conditions (e.g. epilepsy is present in .5% of pregnant women, and the pregnancy alters drug metabolism and treatment prospects all the while it increases the number and frequency of seizures) 
-- severe post-partum depression and psychosis 
-- research now indicates a possible link between ovarian cancer and female fertility treatments, including "egg harvesting" from infertile women and donors 
-- research also now indicates correlations between lower breast cancer survival rates and proximity in time to onset of cancer of last pregnancy 
-- research also indicates a correlation between having six or more pregnancies and a risk of coronary and cardiovascular disease 
These are some less common (but serious) complications: 
-- peripartum cardiomyopathy 
-- cardiopulmonary arrest 
-- magnesium toxicity 
-- severe hypoxemia/acidosis 
-- massive embolism 
-- increased intracranial pressure, brainstem infarction 
-- molar pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease (like a pregnancy-induced cancer) 
-- malignant arrhythmia 
-- circulatory collapse 
-- placental abruption 
-- obstetric fistula 
And a few more permanent side effects: 
-- future infertility 
-- permanent disability 
-- death.
And I'm sure I've missed some.
