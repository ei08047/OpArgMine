Well, that may be your personal approach to 'Evolution by Intelligent Design', but I believe that most people [and the majority of human beings are not geneticists and/or molecular chemists] would say that 'biological evolution', [to their way of thinking and mine], is about whole organisms, not molecules.
In fact, I'm not the least bit interested in debating what atoms and molecules do, in and out of a test tube. So if this is where this discussion is headed, I won't be around for long.
