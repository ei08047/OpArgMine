And what evidence do you have, aside from a set of books written between 1900 and 2800 years ago that there is even a 'God' to box with. OH.. and the ectasy drivien delusional state of mind you get in when you worship.
As for the answer to the origins of life, how would you know? Do you know what the current state of affairs about the knowledge of abiogenesis is? Can you point to articles about it , showing it can't happen?? From peer reviewed journals of course.
NO, you can't. I can show a lot of articles about abiogenesis , but that would be worthless for you. You would be unwilling to look at it. 
I could show you articles about on the development of gender, and of how sexual reproduction became to be formed, but you wouldn't look at it.
