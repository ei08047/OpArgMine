You obviously misunderstood the question. The question was, "how does one explain evolution?" Instead, what you have offered is the creationist straw man assertion about what evolution is. Of course, evolutionary theory has no more to do with the existence or non-existence of any deity than does physics, chemistry, or even plumbing for that matter. They are all equally "atheistic" in that they do not deal with supernatural deities. All of the above (except plumbing) are investigations of natural phenomena. Science does not study the supernatural because it cannot. It lacks the necessary tools to do so. And until you can quantify your god for us, it will remain that way.
And of course, anyone who doesn't lack the integrity to learn at least the basics of what they are arguing against before arguing knows that evolutionary theory doesn't deal with how life, the earth, the universe, or whatever, arose. It seems that you didn't understand the explanations that were offered in this very thread. Evolution deals with how and why heritable chanages in life occur. Evolution deals with heritable changes in populations of organisms. If there are no organisms, then there is no evolution.
