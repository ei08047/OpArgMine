Actually, matter can be created and destroyed. It is total energy that is conserved. One example is in a nuclear reactor. The mass of the fission products is less than that of the original fuel. Matter has been "destroyed." But ov course, it became a form of energy - eventually electricity. On the other side, virtual particles spring into existance all the time in a vacuum. But the are a particle and an anti-particle and the net energy is zero so energy is conserved. These ideas come from quantum mechanics. A virtual particle is a particle that can never be directly detected, but whose existence does have measurable effects. One of those effects is the Casimir effect. It is an attractive pressure between two flat, parallel metal plates placed very near to each other in a vacuum. The pressure is due to the reduced number of virtual particles between the plates. When the plates are very close, only particles of certain resonant wavelengths can exist between them. Thus, more particles on the outside push the plates together.
Stephen Hawking talks a lot about virtual particle pairs in both A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell.
