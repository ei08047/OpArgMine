Mmmmm, not necessarily. Many of the arguments of against gods (those with specific properties, not just a general diety) deal with incompatible traits, like a square circle has. One does not have to search the universe to know square circles do not exist.
People state simple negatives all the time. The lack of evidence for the positive makes them reasonable.
