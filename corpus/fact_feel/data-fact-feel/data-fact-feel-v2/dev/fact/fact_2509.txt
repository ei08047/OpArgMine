Some important concepts (and why the word no longer has meaning in biology) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve. Such concepts were discredited with Darwin. As is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with "creationism". While "creationism" is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one "believes" in evolution. Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution.
