Is supposed to be logical but is a fallacy oft repeated to lure unsuspecting readers to your conclusion without any factual evidence.
It is similar to the claim "stricter gun laws prevent suicides". We know this is false from Japan's history and statistics. We also know from criminologist and sociologists that method substitution does nothing to prevent suicides. In fact, in kanada, suicides increased with stricter gun laws...another failed experiment.
YOUR hint of "developed nations" is misleading and by presentation you try to lure the reader into thinking that gun control only exists in "developed nations" as if there is a superiority in people who inhabit them. 
Tell you what star gazer, list the "undeveloped nations". I would say your nation is barbaric and undeveloped :) At the very least, you demonstrate it is uneducated :)
