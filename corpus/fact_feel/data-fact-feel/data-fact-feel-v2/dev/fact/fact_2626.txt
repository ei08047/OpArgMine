Just look at this media bias! They don't even try to hide it! 
"The creature, called the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is the creation of Bobby Henderson of Corvallis, Ore. "
Excuse me, but no. Bobby Henderson of Corvallis, OR is the creation of the FSM! It's like saying that YHWH is the creation of ancient Israelites! Or that Allah is the creation of Mohammed! This is blatant blasphemy against our Lord and Creator (it's even in the Declaration of Independence for crying out loud! the US is a Pastafarian Nation!) 
We are ALL His creatures. 
"Board chairman Steve Abrams, who voted for the new standards, didn't see the picture but said he thinks that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is silly."
Oh really, Mr. Abrams? Well, you'll think it's really silly when you aren't allowed into heaven to drink from the beer volcano or when you get a real noodling in pasta hell, you heathen!
With all that said, I applaude Mr. Mousley for the courage he has shown in standing up for religious freedom in this carb-forsaken country!
