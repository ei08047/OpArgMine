I watched the program and managed to keep the television switched on despite the distractions from irrelevant images, loud hymn singing, and the editing of Dawkins' contribution - which made him look like a 'mad scientist'.
The claim that Intelligent Design is a novel idea sprung full-armed from the heads of American religious enthusiasts is wrong. What is now loosely called the 'design argument' has been known to philosophers for at least two centuries as an a posteriori argument (literally, 'from backwards'). It is examined at length and dismissed by Hume in his 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion' published in 1779.
