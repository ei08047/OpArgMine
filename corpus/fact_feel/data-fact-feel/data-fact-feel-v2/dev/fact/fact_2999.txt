I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution (i.e. simple life to more complex life). Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading. By this, massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to "evolve" to a human, about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human. That's a lot of information isn't it? Now where does all that information come from? It can't come from a Creator, there's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism. Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied, these acidents are called mutations. 
Is this true though? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution? Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome. They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome. Let's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster, the TNR mutant. What has the mutation done? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? From the point of view of the chook farmer, probably yes, because no feathers - no plucking required. But what about from the point of view of the rooster? Well, he's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer, not much of an improvement for the rooster. This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers. It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation, and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model, i.e. varriation within a kind. See, evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation, but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill, information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird, for example, and change a microbe into a human over eons of years. The problem is, we just don't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today.
Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to, right? Well, actually, natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population. We'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur (or hair) sizes. The population consists of the following fur sizes:
LL - Long fur.
Ll - Medium fur sizes.
ll - Short fur sizes.
where L = long fur gene, and l = short fur gene.
Obviously, the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether. The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go, then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense doesn't it? Take them to a place like Antartica. Over short time, only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive. Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes:
LL - Long fur.
We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population, but, as you can see, the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection. Thus the population has lost information. So natural selection does not add information to the population, it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment, such as the short haired gene (l) in this case.
Hence, neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome.
