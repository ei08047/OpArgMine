Where to start with this proposal? First such a plan could lead to DC style gun control where you could only own a handgun if it was registered with the city, and then they could immediately halt any and all registration at any time, creating a de facto ban.
Then there's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register, and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year, and the fee paid every time as well.
Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason, meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the "only registered guns are legal guns" policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture.
And then there's the fact that registration leads to confiscation. We've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago, we know it's the outright truth. Not long after the New York spree killing, the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated.
And then there's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits, Canada has stated such. Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money, take police off the streets, and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals.
Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons, leaving them untraceable!
