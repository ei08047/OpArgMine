If our core is our mind, what is the mind? It is the brain, which is an organ and considered a body part. In reality, "mind" is an intangible byproduct of the body. However, the brain depends on other organs like the heart and lungs to keep going. The heart and lungs are in turn regulated by the brain. As you have said before, we don't have any evidence the mind lives on without the body. Therefore, it appears the existence of the mind is dependant on the existence of the body, not the other way around. This makes sense, since it is obviously the body that begins to develop first.
