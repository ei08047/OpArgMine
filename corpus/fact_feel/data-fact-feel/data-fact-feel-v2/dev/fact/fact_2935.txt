" 'Arms' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals. The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War. Gandhi was an extreme anti-militarist. The statement is odd coming out of him, but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of Home Rule and Independence."
