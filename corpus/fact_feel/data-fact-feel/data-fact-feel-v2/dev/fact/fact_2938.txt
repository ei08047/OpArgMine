Some creationists would probably think he's a genius. Unfortunately for him, that's not exactly something to brag about.
This example was used on IIDB and shows the dichotomy with which SS's views conflict with reality: Polar bears are birthed in temperate climates all the time, thanks to zoos. Do they revert back to the fur color of a brown bear? No. Instead, SS finds a picture of dirty polar bear cubs and says, "Look, brown!"
Another good simple counterargument is that superspeed adaptation would prevent anything from dying due to extreme conditions at birth. Maybe SS would like to take his chihuahua to Antarctica to birthe its puppies and see if they even live, let alone look like Siberian huskies.
