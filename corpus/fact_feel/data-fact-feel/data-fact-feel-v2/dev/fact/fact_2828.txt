First of all, gun violence is no joke, but your figures are way too high if you are talking about criminal gun violence. Which is the subject of this group of threads. But you guys push for stuff that will have little to no impact on gun violence. Stuff like an Assault Weapons ban. So called Assault Weapons even if were dis-invented would have less impact than lets say murders committed by beating people to death with hands, and feet. Which by the way, also shows the futility of banning guns in the first place. 
Brady,  I have shown you who commits murder.  You are NEVER going to stop all of that by punishing those who don't take drugs, or sell them, or commit crimes. If you were actually serious about doing what you say you want to do, you would be designing and pushing for resolutions to deal with the actual evidence. 
Let me also show you what the FBI says are the pertinent factors.
