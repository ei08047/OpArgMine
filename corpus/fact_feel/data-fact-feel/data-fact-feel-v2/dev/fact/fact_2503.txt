I see patterns here. My girlfriend and I have been debating this subject a lot lately. When we first started debating, she did so in "solid support of creationism" (yes Frog I did not write those words by accident). She said, and I quote, "Evolution is bullsh*t". Last night, after two or three evenings of this stuff back and forth (after I resoundingly bested her on every point, basically) she affirmed that she does believe in evolution and has "kind of" always believed in evolution, but that she has many reservations and questions about it.
The pattern? "Solid support of creationism turns into an admission that evolution is the truth, but with reservations." I find that pattern a little bit amusing.
Last night, she had abandoned most of her philosophical objections because I made the concession that everyone has to make if they want to make any headway whatsoever with a budding evolutionist who can't let go of their religious objections: "Okay, maybe it had God's stamp of approval." When you say that, you can move on to a real conversation. In this case, she bombarded me with a million questions that I couldn't answer. She seemed excited about it, not debating, but asking me about the wonders of biology with a long series of "...but what about this" and "...what about that" type of questions. One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem. I couldn't quite grasp what she was asking because I don't think she herself was very clear on the question, but to make a long story short, I got the distinct impression that she simply can't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she can't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it. I have told her time and time again: "Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it wrong." I see this same pattern here in your words, Frog. You're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do, because they're wasting their money. You're making this subject so much bigger and more philosophical than it has to be, Frog. Is evolution by far the best answer we have to the question of the diversity of species? The answer is yes, overwhelmingly so. Everything else is moot. It belongs elsewhere.
