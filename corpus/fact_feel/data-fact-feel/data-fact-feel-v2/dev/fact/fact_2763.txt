Theories change since they are just that - theories. Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight, they become laws. Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, itâ€™s the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience.
