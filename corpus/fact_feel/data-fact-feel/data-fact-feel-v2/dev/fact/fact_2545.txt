That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species.
