So you solely have a problem with the theory of evolution, but anything in science that doesn't involve this theory seems sound to you. Correct?
2 questions:
If you trust the scientific method in the rest of science, and you feel the processes are sound, how do you account for the overwhelming acceptance of evolution? I mean, are the scientists whose field may involve evolution unique in their lack of integrity and are singularly foolish in endorsing evolution by natural selection? If the "evolutionists" are shills (for whom I am not clear), why is it the other scientists are trustworthy. Do the evolutionary sciences select for a certain type of person.
Does your religious belief have any influence on your lack of acceptance of evolution.
