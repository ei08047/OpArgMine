Yours is the voice of a bitter gay person talking, who has only seen one side of things (probably hardship). But there are many good examples of the population being informed and doing things right. In fact I think typcially, the populace DOES take care of people--I think Americans are generally pretty humanitarian people. That's my opinion.
I think the reason there has been resistance to redefine marriage is that people really know that this is not a civil rights issue, despite attempts by the gay lobby to paint it that way. I will say this though: gay people need to be treated as well as anyone else in this country and acts of violence should not be permitted. We should all be able to get along. But that doesn't mean we should have to redefine marriage to do it.
As I said, states have the ability to amend their constitution to protect the institution of marriage from redefinition, and 13 states have already done so--many others are working on it. You should probably get used to it. Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily.
