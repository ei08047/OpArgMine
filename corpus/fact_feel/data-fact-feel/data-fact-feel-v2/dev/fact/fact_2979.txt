actually, proof of something comes down to 2 things: agreeing on what the definition of the thing is, and agreeing on evidence that verifies the thing
wind is defined as movement of air. air moves, therefore wind exists. this has been proven. i dont know what kind of definition you used, but it doesnt seem like your assignment is that difficult.
God, on the other hand, is elusive even at the definition stage. he is sometimes defined as creator of the world, a higher force, all-powerful, greatest being possible, love, etc...
unless a definition is agreed upon, even beginning to prove existance is difficult. suppose we define God as love. love exists, therefore God exists. however, not everybody agrees to this definition. suppose we define God as creator of the universe. sciences states the the universe was created spontaneously, therefore God doesnt exist. therefore, for some, either this definition is not satisfactory or the conclusion of the scientists isnt satisfactory.
finding proof for the existence of God becomes increasingly difficult when Gods definition gets constantly revised and adjusted. if we could simply agree on the definition for God then we could begin to find a proof.
