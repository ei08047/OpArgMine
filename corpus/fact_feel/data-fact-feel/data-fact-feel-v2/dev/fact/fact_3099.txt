A lot more truth to this statement that a person would think. My statement was in jest, but somewhat true. Yes, the jurors could not vote on concrete evidence, but just how much circumstantial evidence do jurors need anyway ? To quote the mighty TS, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, craps like a duck, at what point does it become a duck ??
