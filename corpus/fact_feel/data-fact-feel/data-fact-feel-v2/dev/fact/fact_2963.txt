The first problem would be finding a country where there has been a sucessful gun ban. As far as I know, every country on the planet experiences some violence related gun use, even the ones with draconian gun control laws. Even in te Soviet Union, where posession of illegal firearms could potentially lead to a death sentence, there was still shootings.
