As should be plainly obvious, this is an almost total ban on all semi-automatic weapons in the City of Columbus, not just those that have been traditionally considered 'assault weapons' (automatic firearms).
Note definition (L)(2). Almost every semi-automatic pistol is included in that definition.
Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad (or constitutional), or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad (or constitutional), it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban.
