I know at least one person from the Netherlands who owns a pistol. Are you sure that it is ENTIRELY illegal to own a firearm, or is it possible to obtain a permit for one?
Also, the whole "school shooting" business in the US is not really any sort of major problem. The thing is, the media reports every single incident making it seem more common than it really is.
As far as uses for a gun: In the US lots of people live in rural areas where it could take police about an hour, or even longer, to respond. People in that situation cannot rely on police protection. In addition, our police force is NOT obligated to serve as a protection force for citizens. Instead, our police are supposed to solve crimes after they occur.
People in the US grew up with firearms and shooting sports. Hunting, trap and skeet, and target shooting are important parts of American culture. In fact, our government thought it was so important for citizens to be able to use firearms that they created the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The CMP sells high-powered military surplus rifles at cost, to US citizens.
Joszi and Bram, what experience with firearms do you have? Maybe a day at the range would change your opinions. :)
