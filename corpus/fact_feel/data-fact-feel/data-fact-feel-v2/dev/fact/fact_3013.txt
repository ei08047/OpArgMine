So we haven’t had rulers in the past commit atrocities at a massive level when atheism wasn’t as prevalent? If I find a Christian leader who killed millions, would you accept that Christianity is just as dangerous as atheism (and by just as dangerous I mean not at all dangerous, it’s the immoral people that do wrong. Now if you would like to show that crime is committed mainly by atheists (percentage wise) then you could have a point… but until then…)
