You've forced me to get out of my chair and dig through the bookshelf. :)
Hardcopy Funk and Wagnalls copyrighted 1954 -1956 reads as follows:
"Other atomospheric gases are argon, 9400 ppm; ... neon 18 p.p.m.; ... xenon. 0.09 p.p.m. The carbon-dioxide content of the air is about 0.03 percent by volume. Although it may be subject to slight local variations, this percentage is maintained nearly constant by carbon dioxide dissolving into or evaporating from the waters of the oceans. The carbon dioxide content of sea water is about a thousand times as great as that of the atmosphere."
Wikipedia is a handy tool but I don't give them credit for understanding what the reality of our atmosphere was 65 years ago - let alone 150 years ago. 
Now these ppm readings: What is the 0.03% comparison?
