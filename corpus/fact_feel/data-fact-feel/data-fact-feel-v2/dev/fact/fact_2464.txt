No... you're not entirely correct. You can be skeptical all you want, but the empirical evidence is overwhelming for a world wide flood, a global cataclysm... as I stated earlier, you're not even taken seriously even in the secualar world of "science" if you try to refute the flood record, the flood is solid and is not privy to question. Enoch built the first pyramids, and his were superior in quality to he knock-offs of later days. The flood has been dated to have occured about 4400 to 4600 B.C.
