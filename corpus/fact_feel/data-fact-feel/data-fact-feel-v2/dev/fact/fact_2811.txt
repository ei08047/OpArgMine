Make up your mind. Above you were claiming that there is evidence of your god and now you are claiming that it is a matter of faith. My faith is something different from evolution. I take nothing in science by faith. Science is based on empirical evidence - that means the I can quantify it in some way. Of course, if there is empirical evidence for your god, then your god is not supernatural but just another part of the universe.
But isn't it funny that you creationists always think that the worst insult you can throw at science is to call it faith? Sadly, you are unable to reject the dogma of the mythology of ancient, nomadic herdsmen. To assert that as science is certainly not thinking for oneself.
