Well, if that is your perspective, yes, I can see why you would think they are the same idea. However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording.
Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence. Although it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe. Creationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.
Because it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist:
1. Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor.
2. The earth is about six thousand years old.
3. Life on earth did not have a common ancestor.
4. Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits.
5. Belief in catastrophism, usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation.
6. There was a sudden creation of the universe, life, and energy from nothing.
None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory. Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory. ID proposes the following:
1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design. 
2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity. 
3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity. 
4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.
