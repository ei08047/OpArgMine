"The"? There is no single interpretation of the ToE. There is a debate going on between supporters of Punctuated Equilibrium and Gradualism, for example. It doesn't matter that this website asserts that this one interpretation is accepted.
I don't think I accept it, but I don't know for sure, as you seem to have chosen a website which is unclear on some points. (Of course, the websites that are not unclear don't often support your point of view...)
