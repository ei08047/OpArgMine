Thanks for the link it was an interesting read.
I found the comment in the second to last paragraph most intriguing:
'Scientists have also identified the smallest number of genes required to sustain life in a bacterial cell (about 350). If they can overcome the many technical hurdles of building a wholly artificial cell in the lab, it is conceivable they could "create" - albeit simple - "life". '
Who knows what that line of research might lead us to?
