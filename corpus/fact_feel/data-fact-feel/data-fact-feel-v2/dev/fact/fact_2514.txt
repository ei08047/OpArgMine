Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.
