That has nothing whatsoever to do with my post that you replied to. I was agreeing with a post by Flygirl which pointed out that the hospital displayed a basic lack of common decency, which I trust you also agree with. Gay marriage or not, the hospital could have and should have allowed visitation. After all, some hospitals do--they are each a business and can do as they choose. There is a lot of activism going on in terms of getting hospitals to do this. See Gay rights groups launch hospital rating system, and the report itself.
