Hmmm, you cannot study the laws of logic. That’s like saying we cannot study math because it as no effect on us. Try violating the law of non-contradiction in a test you take. Say to person that is giving the test, “The wrong answer can be the right answer at the same time sir, because the law of non-contradiction has no effect and does not exist for me, beside its impossible it study the laws of logic or anything abstract like this test.”
