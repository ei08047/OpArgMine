If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.
As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator.
