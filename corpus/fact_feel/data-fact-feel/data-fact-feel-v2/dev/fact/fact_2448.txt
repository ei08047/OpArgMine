You've had problems with this in other threads. You've said that a modification to the genome is not new information, just 'altered' information, which makes no sense at all. You can't alter information. You can alter physical stuff so that it stops representing one piece of information and starts representing another, but the idea that the information has altered is way off base. I could turn any sentence into any other sentence - even into a sentence that has never been written before - just by tweaking the letters one by one. Is the end product not a 'new' sentence?
