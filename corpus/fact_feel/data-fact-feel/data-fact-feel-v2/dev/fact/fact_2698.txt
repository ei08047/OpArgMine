Kellermann, in one of his studies, compared criminal homicides to legally justifiable homicides. He compared homicides to homicides (FBI data does the same) which seems more fair than your comparison- comparing only gun homicides to all types of crime supposedly prevented by crime according to one very controversial study. And I never said the war on drugs was a mistake.
