Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it.
In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's "prenumbra" theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred:
"Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `libertyÂ´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'"

This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . .
Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens.
Just for info sake, Harlan's dissent is also quoted in the plurality (Stevens concurring) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961)
