Oh, really, pregnancy is not expensive? Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands (tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken.
