Actually the Bible/creation makes quite a lot predictions that science has recently verified. Some examples include: that the Earth is round (Isa. 40:22); the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7); sea currents; the hydrologic cycle; the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa 51:6); and the fact that Orion cluster is seperating and that the Pleadies cluster is staying together as a group (Job 38:31); and many others. Since there was a global flood according to the Bible, we would expect there to be many fossils rapidly despoited and this is what we see in some parts of the fossil record. For example, there are some fossil beds are found in sedimentary rock, deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while still giving birth and eating food. Creationists have also made predictions such as the fact that there can be variation with in a kind, but one kind cannot change into other kinds. This is what we observe now in the present, and is backed up by the fossil record. We would expect that many rocks, such as Uluru in Australia, would not be "ordered in layers". Once again, this is what we observe. Creationists predicted that mutations and natural selection are down hill processes, i.e. information losing. We would also expect everything to be running down, we might also expect to know that some dinosaurs survived the flood but most likely died in the ice age that followed the flood. Several cultural groups have given very descriptive information about dinosaur like creatures. Remember, they would not have had a picture book with dinosaurs in it, the Aboriginal's for example, had paintings of dinosaur like creatures in caves; the amazing amount of design and complexity in the universe; Laws of Nature. Also many other predictions. 
So as you can see, creationists have made many predictions (as has the Bible) and all are 100% scientificly correct. IF, if such fossils are found and they are obviously transitional, then that would certainly aid the evolutionist case. But evolution is supposed to have millions of transitional fossils, they have a hand full of highly debatable ones.
Btw, I am not trying to impress you by any means of your imagination. If I wanted to impress someone I could stay here and away from the internet. It is just that "evolution" is not as "scientific" as you may think.
