You are absolutely correct. Scientists do science. Philosophers wander around inside their own domain. On the other hand I am much more interested in the scientific merits of NDS and EAM than in the musings of philosophers. Science supports NDS, science fails to support the vitalist views of EAM. Simple as that. Its not a philosophical issue, its a scientific one.
