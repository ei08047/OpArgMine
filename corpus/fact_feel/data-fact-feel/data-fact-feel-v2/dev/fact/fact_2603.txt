Well, it wasn't just a footnote that Lott supposedly lost. It was all his raw data to support his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. And Lott did lie because changed his story about who conducted the story. 
"When Lott cited the statistic peripherally on page three of his book, he attributed it to 'national surveys.' In the second edition, he changed the citation to 'a national survey that I conducted.' He has also incorrectly attributed the figure to newspaper polls and Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck."

So was it a newspaper poll? Did Kleck conduct it? Now Lott claims he did it. 
If true, he must have been lying when he said that others conducted the study. 
"He has forgotten the names of the students who allegedly helped with the survey and who supposedly dialed thousands of survey respondents long-distance from their own dorm rooms using survey software Lott can't identify or produce."
Interesting how he can't remember anyone who helped him.
"Lott now admits he used a fake persona, 'Mary Rosh,' to post voluminous defenses of his work over the Internet. 'Rosh' gushed that Lott was 'the best professor that I ever had.' She/he also penned an effusive review of 'More Guns, Less Crime' on Amazon.com: "It was very interesting reading and Lott writes very well." (Lott claims that one of his sons posted the review in 'Rosh's' name.) Just last week, 'Rosh' complained on a blog comment board: "Critics such as Lambert and Lindgren ought to slink away and hide." 
"By itself, there is nothing wrong with using a pseudonym. But Lott's invention of Mary Rosh to praise his own research and blast other scholars is beyond creepy. And it shows his extensive willingness to deceive to protect and promote his work."
