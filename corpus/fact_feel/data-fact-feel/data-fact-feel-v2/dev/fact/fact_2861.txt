Most scientists agree that there needs to be a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order for pain to be registered as such. The cerebral cortex is not sufficiently developed enough in the fetus to feel pain until roughly the start of the third trimester. Otherwise, the movements of an early fetus or embryo away from a stimulus are simply reflex action. Those of you who might have disected a frog in biology class in High School might have experienced it yourself when seeing the leg of a newly dead frog move under stimulus. For the novice, it may appear to be a reaction to a felt pain but it is not.
Here is one link to a comprehensive study on fetal pain made by the American Medical Association:
