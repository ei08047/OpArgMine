It could be argued that the delays in germanies advancement due to armed civil defenses gave the allies a chance to mobilize. IT is a case of "what might have happened", though, so it is impossible to tell for sure. With Hitler you had a unique situation which involved a tyrant and a lunatic in charge of a country, but with the popular support of the population.
I would have to agree that resistance against Hitler didn't lead to any great victories. Of course, (and playing "might have been again") if more people had realised what kind of threat he actually posd, perhaps the resistance would have been more popular and successful.

It is rather difficult to debate with PH, isn't it? I think it is because he doesn't debate, he just types s bunch of XXXX and then goes "SO THERE!". It is amusing to watch, though/
