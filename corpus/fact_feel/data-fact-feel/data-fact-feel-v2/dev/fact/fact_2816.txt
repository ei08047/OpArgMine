And who is it @1790 that said the right of the people to bear arms ONLY related to active duty militia members? 
It makes little sense to argure ambiguity and precision at the same time, but that is what Cornell does. His argument is internally inconsistent in that in an effort to undermine the standard model, he argues that there was no agreement on what the RKBA meant, but then he proposes a narrow/exclusive right which would reguire more, not less, precision -though he can not cite even one person from that time articulating such a narrow right. 
Why would one assume that the civics rights model, which demands exclusivity, is to be favored over the standard model which does not ? Note that the standard model encompasses a right to keep and bear arms for one's own defense as well as to contribute to the common defense so is consistent with various statements from that time (i.e. see Bryan's non-exhaustive list of citations from that era). However the civic rights model proposed by Cornell does not fit with what was said by J.Wilson, R,Sherman, and other framers.
