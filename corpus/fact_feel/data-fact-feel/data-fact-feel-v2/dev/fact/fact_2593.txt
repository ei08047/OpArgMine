Sorry but I think you are mistaken in that the bible "describes" dinosaurs. The first description is most certainly a description of the hippopotamus, which were abundant in Egypt, etc. The second seems to be crocodile of some sort. Most likely the Nile crocodile. Tanniyn is not just described as dragon, but also as serpent or scaly creature. At that time there was no other large scaly creature other than the Nile crocodile. They might have been describing a whale, but whales do not have scales.
As to your claim of evolution, that depends on what "God" would mean by "create." YOU can create something out of something else can't you? So than evolution is a possibility.
