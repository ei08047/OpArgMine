Well by the Flood, I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis?
Fossils we find today have been attributed to a remarkable variety of environmental settings that allowed them to be preserved. Also, you seem to be refering to the preservation of large animals such as terrestrial vertebrates, which are far rarer than fossils of marine organisms with calcarous skeletons. In that regard, some types of rock are basically one huge fossil as most of their composition is derived from dead animal material.
There are just so many different types in which creatures are preserved it is not possible to consider the events within the context of a word like "tragic" Unusual? sometimes. In some cases the word inevitable is the most apt.
Also, there are quite a few numbers of ways in which animals have been preserved without the direct involvement of water/sedimentation- terrestrial invertebrates trapped in amber, tarpit "traps" like those of the famous Rancho la Brea with remarkable preservations of ice-age mammal fauna and mummified animals from desert environments (off the top of my head). Plus then you have a whole set of fossils preserved in water conditions where there has been very slow, low energy deposition of sediments, like black shales and the Lithographic limestones of Solnhofen.
