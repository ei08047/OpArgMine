Hey, bring it on. A month ago, I read over your 'failed prophecies' and if you are ready to listen, there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt.
It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes, but the long and short of it is this: you don't even begin to know the God you are dealing with. 
If you give me a space of time to get things together, I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you're his "buddy" then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses (Ps. 50)
Here's a hint though about what happened in Egypt: God changed his mind. But you didn't know he could do that? You would be surprised how much like you he really is. He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible: Abraham tried to get Him to but couldn't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God was out to kill Moses' sons, but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind, also Moses succeeded in changing God's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites, God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented, God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins, I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them. 
But be careful - when He is set on doing something, it gets done. Just when you think you have a "pal" in God, he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel: when a land sins against Me, though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it, they will deliver but their own souls.
Even righteous Noah couldn't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world. 
Real quick: one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king. Happens time and time again in scripture. Don't have time to elaborate right now. Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations. So while God is using him to punish Egypt, He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well. Get it? Is it too mature for you? Don't believe it? Too bad....it's true. God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations. When He is through using them, He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original "servant" so to speak. This is mature teaching. Most Christians don't like it. Too bad....it's true. You don't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day. One day, He will be finished with you as well. Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this (God is speaking): All these things you have done and I kept silent. You thought I was altogether like you, but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces. Ps 50:21
Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy?' God changed His mind! Maybe you ought to start praying that He will change His mind about your destiny as well.
