Well I can't agree to that, the 'evidence' for ID was all over the place before Darwin came up with a naturalistic solution.
Evidence sufficient for proof does not exist but inferential evidence does exist anytime you observe biology.
I made a point a while ago about semantics, it was countered as a point mattering to evolution by pointing out it was just semantics which I quite agree with.
The point still stands that people can hardly speak about biology without using words like 'designed for' and 'because' implying purpose.
You don't hear things like that about geology and chemistry for a reason, they are not complex functioning systems which fulfill a purpose.
The surprising part would be if systems fulfill a purpose without being formed by purpose.
