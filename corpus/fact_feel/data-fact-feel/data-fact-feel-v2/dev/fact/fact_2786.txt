Wilkinson is as full of **** as you are. When we brought the Heller case before the Supreme Court, we wanted them to determine whether or not DC's handgun laws, which weren't voted on but rather just passed without debate, were constitutional or not. That's the job of the Supreme Court, to determine if a law is unconstitutional or if it may be allowed to remain as law.
Your standard of pressing legislators to pass one law to repeal another is just plain stupid. The only ones who we could ask to do such are the DC people who threw their full support behind the DC gun ban, proclaiming that it was both constitutional and reasonable, and should be allowed to remain. There was absolutely no way of using the ballot to get anything done.
And another thing. There's absolutely no political agenda here, whatsoever. All we want is for one part of the Bill of Rights to be treated with the same equality and respect as all the other parts.
