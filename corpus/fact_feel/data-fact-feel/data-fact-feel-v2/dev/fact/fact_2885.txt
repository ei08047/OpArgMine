Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?
I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.
