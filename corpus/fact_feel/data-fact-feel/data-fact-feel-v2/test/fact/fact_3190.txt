Wow, I hope I'm not the only person who went directly to your source to check it out. Lets review several points here:
1)The need to display current information. This article is almost four years old, I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush's presidency. George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history, few will argue this whether they support him or not. Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details. This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years. The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true.
2)The need to display information from a reputable source. Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out. This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda. The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality. I'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced.
3)Make sure the parts of your source that you don't quote don't contain info that harms your argument. Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion. If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion. Flynt says so himself:
