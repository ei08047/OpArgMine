We don't take him seriously anymore because despite having been refuted over and over (both here and on at least four other boards), he still posts the same garbage. Whenever it looks like there has been overwhelming refutation of his thread, he abandons it and starts a new one saying basically the same thing as the one before it. THAT is why he isn't taken seriously, and no, it is not "unfair". I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts, when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site, or say things like "science is a joke" My pet dog could do better.
