Is this chart the number of abortions in the U.S., internationally, or both? The chart is under the international section on the website.
What is considered "emergency contraception" as stated on the chart?
Didn't PP perform 213,026 abortions in 2001? In 2002 the number of abortions they performed actually increased right?
You say that "by number of people" the "main business" of PP is offering contraception and sex ed. What is their "main business" by revenue?
