Perhaps, but as studies have noted, contributing the growing of livestock is one of top things one can do to harm the environment.
"The livestock sector is a major player [in climate change], responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalent. This is a higher share than transport."
I've read that methane and nitrous oxide have greater warming potential than Co2.
Furthermore, IF the government were to become involved and create an objective to reduce meat consumption in a country I'm sure the people would be aware as to why and make their choices. Living green is already a popular topic so many people who are not already aware of efficient energy use would eventually learn if this issue came to a front.
