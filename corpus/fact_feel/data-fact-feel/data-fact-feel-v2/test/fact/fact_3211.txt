So we can't base our definition of "kind" on mere appearances?
I mean if we are going to put things into categories and call the category "kind", we should do this by common appearances. A penguin is in the same kind as a hummingbird, but is a lobster in the same kind as an oyster? Obviously a lobster and a shrimp would be in the same kind, but could a dolphin and a manatee be in the same kind? Did they evolve from a common ancestor kind?
And since apes look and act so much like humans, didn't they just evolve from humans? By all appearances, they we must all be in the same kind.
