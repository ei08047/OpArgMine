too bad darwinian evolution has nothing to do with it.....proven by the fact that not ONE example of a beneficial random mutation can be presented/proven, nor can ONE example of natural selection be proven on the level of the individual. Thus, there's only one thing left....lamarckian inheritance. The body simply has the ability to transmit information about the external environment. It's that simple.
see the butterfly link in the OP.
