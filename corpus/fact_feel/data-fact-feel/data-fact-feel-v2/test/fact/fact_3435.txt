No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.
Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.
