Actually you are incorrect. I have heard this explanation before and at the risk of being rude its given by people who don't actually under stand what is meant by "testing a theory." You can not successfully test a theory. Once a theory has been successfully tested it is no longer a theory. When sceince refers to testing a theory it's a process of creating an experiment using what they do know to find out what they don't know, but it never proves the theory. It can often find another peice of the puzzle that when theorized can help support the theory, but that is not surprising given the theory was used as the experimental modul. 
As such the tests only provide additional information (or education) for the educational guess. Unfortuantly mathmatics and sceince use testing a theory in different ways and the layaman often confuses the two. 
In Mathematics it is possible to test and retest using different mathematical variables and come up with numerous examples of success and it still be a theory. The reason for this is that mathematics in itself is theoretical. By that meaning it is non-physical and can only be approximated. However such is not the case for science. 
I would not go so far as claim you are being equivocative because I think it’s ignorance not misrepresentation on your part. However, That’s the last I will talk about the term theory either people can accept the definition or not. Even if they disagree if they can not discuss within that frame work quite frankly they probably aren’t at the educational/critical level to discuss the concepts.
If someone wants to prove me wrong simply give me a scientific theory that has been successfully tested.
