Hello, Nu Leader.
Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to "prove" evolution. One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it. So, the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes.
Incidentally, I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.
I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it.
