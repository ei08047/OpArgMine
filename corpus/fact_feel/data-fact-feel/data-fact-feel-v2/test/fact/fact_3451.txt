Oh goodie, same MO. First a biased claim repeated on Yahoo from canned propaganda source, VPC with a few quotes from staunch marxists that would like to ignore the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution, then you include the suppositions and dire warnings which have never come true but you are not finished yet. Your quote contains the usual lies about training and education plus an appeal to interfere with State Rights which 34 States have specifically stated their support of through their State AG. Not enough yet? "well it's a right" is no longer an argument, it is fact. Read Heller v D.C. and the myriad of cases including 35 Supreme Court cases that have always held the Second Amendment protects those individual rights. Even Roe v Wade states the rights found in the BOR such as ..."the right to keep and bear arms" to be a fundamental right.
What you have is an unConstitutional right being demeaned by a person who swore an oath to protect and defend it...making them/him a traitor.
