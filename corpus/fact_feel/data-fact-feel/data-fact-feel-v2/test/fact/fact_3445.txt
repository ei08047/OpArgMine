Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo, so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual which evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. 
And ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also.
