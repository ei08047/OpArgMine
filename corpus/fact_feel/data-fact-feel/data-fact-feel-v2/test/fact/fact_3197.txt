I once walked into Halbergs office in an effort to borrow a big XY plotter his group had available. Before I left he overwhelmed me with an extended lecture on chronobiology and his current work as well as a large sheath of reprints and reviews. A very vocal advocate of his field (and it WAS his field) and quite a character. Of course I met him in the morning and perhaps he was on a chronobiological peak at the time who can say. Anyway I did get access to the plotter for some chemical work I was doing, and I learned a bit about his work and interests. Productive meeting.
