You mean where the judge did the job she's paid to do by ruling on the constitutionality of a law? Or is this only a problem when it's laws that you like that are ruled unconstitutional?
This is Civics 101. If the legislature writes a law that is unconstitutional, it's the job of the judicial branch to strike it down. The legislature can then rewrite the law, or get the constitution amended. I've yet to see you demonstrate this process being abused in the matter of gay marriage. All you've done is point out rulings you don't like.
