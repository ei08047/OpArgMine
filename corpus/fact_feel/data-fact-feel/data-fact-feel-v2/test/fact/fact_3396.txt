The darwinian notion has had no payoff. The fact of evolution, as descent with modification from one or a few common ancestors, predates darwin by hundreds of years, and is not the private property of materialism/mechanism/darwinism.
The real "payoffs come from 2 sources--the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel's inheritance theory, and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation', as opposed to passive particulate 'selection', in evoltion.
Have to go now.
