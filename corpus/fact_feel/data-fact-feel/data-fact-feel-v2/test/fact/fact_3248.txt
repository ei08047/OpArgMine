In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.
