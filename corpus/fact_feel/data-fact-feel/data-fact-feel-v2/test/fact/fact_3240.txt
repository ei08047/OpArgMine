Well, your question doesn't need the macro bit in there as evolution happens or it doesn't, the "macro" bit is once again an artifact of our view on the world (ie. our short lives make it rather difficult to see evolution shape anything other than the organisms with the fastest of reproductive cycles.) Given we have evidence of life (fossils) changing over time (radiometric dating and stratigraphy) we know it takes many of thousands, if not millions of years for noticable to-the-eye changes in animals to occur. Once again it is important to consider perspective- we only have the equivalent of a few frames (fossils) from the movie of life (geological time) and there is much that is lost to history forever. Still, enough remains to support evolution, unless you were to purposefully disregard the facts we find.
On your final point it is rather out of context, and I suspect not accidentally so. I'm not sure what on earth consitutes "convincing evidence" for any philosphical outlook on life, be it theistic or otherwise.
