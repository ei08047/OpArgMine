Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality (Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ's College, Cambridge that Paley did). The argument from design is presented as "proof" of God or an "intelligent" designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism. But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore isn't "proof". Evolutionary biologists don't assert that there is not god, only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one.
Science is naturalistic. Even if some scientists (and others) are philosophical naturalists, science doesn't work that way. It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural. It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism.
