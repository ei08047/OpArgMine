Nice job not addressing anything I said.
I am not a radical, just informed. I used to work for a sexual violence center and counseled rape victims in college. I am also a victim. Keeping myself up to date on sex crimes is important to me, partly because I want all that can be done to prevent it done. Pointing a finger at gays like this does not do that. 
This pyschologist sums it up nicely:
