No one saw a man's track for 100 million years. You told me that you had read the material at the links. Did you lie or is it that you didn't understand any of it? Some of the best "man tracks" were found by removing the soil on top of the slab. Some of the tracks were only the shallow impression of the middle part of the tridactyl print. Mr. Carl Baugh claimed these were human tracks. He convinced John Morris of the ICR. After these tracks had been exposed for about 10 years, Glen Kuban invited John Morris back to look again. In some of those tracks the softer infill has since eroded to show clearly the tridactyl nature of the tracks. In others, the infill has changed color by being exposed to the river water. The outline of the entire track is vivible in the stone. John Morris now agrees that there is no track in the river that was made by a human.
I am amazed that you went to visit this river and didn't go inside the Park Headquarters. They have a very nice display that explains the history. Also there are signs at various points of access to the river with signs with information. How is it that you paid attention to none of it.
But you said in your original post, "The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances, the toes." That just isn't true. You didn't see that in the river. Maybe you stopped at Mr. Carl Baugh's "Creation Evidence Museum" and saw his carved footprint and his cast of a Pleurocoelus print in which he imagines he sees a human track. He gives a lovely ad hoc explanation about how the person slipped and the toes are turned under.
I think that maybe you forgot your hat on the day you went to Glen Rose. It's hot in Texas and you were having delusions if you saw what you claim in the river.
