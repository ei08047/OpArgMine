And you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference, as you whine that there is one ...
A person goes to the doctor, that information is NOT public information. A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.
But with the "knowthyneighbor", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.
If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes
