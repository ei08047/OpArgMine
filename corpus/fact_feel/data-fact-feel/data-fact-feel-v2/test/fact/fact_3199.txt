Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo. Now we're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill, reasonable gun control, access to abortion and contraception (without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members)... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world? No, but things like slavery, sexism, rampant crime, and politicization of private issues are.
