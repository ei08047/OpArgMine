The first refutation is not a refutation at all - it is a retreat. No longer is God all-poweful, but he is all-powerful within the realm of logic. That reminds me of the guy in Monty Python's Life of Brian who says "Besides the sanitation, the education, the aqueduct, the public order, etc. what have the Romans ever done for us?"
The second refutation sounds like something Rousseau said, along the lines of "I don't care about logic. I'll believe in God privately." If one can claim that the power of God is beyond logic, but still true, then one can also claim that the powerlessness of God is beyond logic, but true. Similarily, I can claim that "2+2=5" is true by saying "We humans are too simple-minded to understand it, therefore it must be true." That's fallacious.
