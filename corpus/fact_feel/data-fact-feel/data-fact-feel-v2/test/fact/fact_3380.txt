Well, as Jaaman see it, Heaven does forbid it!
I myself am getting worried, look at Virgina. They have enacted law that stops even relationship contracts and healthcare for gays and lesbians. If that were to happen in my state, my parter would loose his healthcare because it is from my work. (He is self-employed). I read where people will just move to states where they feel accpeted, then others will move to states with laws that agree with their beliefs. Soon we will be a divided country.
