Let's see, what else in science isn't the absolute truth.....
Well, it's still the heliocentric theory, so the earth orbitting the sun isn't the absolute truth. It's still the germ theory so germs and viruses causing disease isn't the absolute truth. It's still the atomic theory so atoms aren't the absolute truth and since chemistry stems from the atomic theory (chemicals and elements are, according to the theory, made up of atoms) chemistry isn't the absolute truth. gravity can't be the absolute truth because it's still the theory of gravity. And electricity sure can't be the absolute truth because it's part of the electromagnetic theory. It should also be noted that the theory of evolution is one of the most well supported theories in science, even though it isn't the absolute truth.
