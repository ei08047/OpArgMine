Yes, they do. So why should you make the same mistake? We correct creationists about this mistake all the time on other boards. See talkorigins debate board. That Hi_Its_Me went along with the mistake showed that he was no longer discussing evolution or even science, but arguing atheism vs theism.
The reason we do this is because science and evolution are not atheism and scientific theories have boundaries. No scientific theory gives a worldview or an explanation of everything. Even the anticipated "theory of everything" combining Relativity and QM won't explain everything. Evolution has the boundary of the first life. It assumes that a universe and living organisms exist. Just like Cell Theory assumes the same things. If you want to discuss the origin of the first life, then you have to talk about the various theories within the field of abiogenesis. If you want to talk about the origin of the universe, then you need to discuss the various theories within the field of cosmology.
