And what's more, the huge numbers of uninsured are getting their health care for free - at least what they get. An uninsured person brought in to an emergency room with a heart attack is a total loss to the hospital and the doctor. Maybe it would have been cheaper to get that poor soul high blood pressure pills. Where do you think the money comes from for his hospital stay? Our pockets too in the form of higher costs to those who can pay. There's no free ride for any of us.
