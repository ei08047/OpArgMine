Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion. This one has to do with babys in the woumb 
"Befor I formmed you in the woumb, I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations" 
Jeremiah 1:4-5
I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through.
