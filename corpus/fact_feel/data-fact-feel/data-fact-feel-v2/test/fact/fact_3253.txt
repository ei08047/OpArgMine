Well, I can more easily explain what it is NOT.
In my latter ID days, I was arguing for a form of Directed Panspermia, with the aliens themselves having arisen by purely natural means - starting off as simpler organisms than us, but then evolving intelligence - and then creating life as we know it. Without getting into details, imagine what we humans will probably due in 100 years or so: create a new form of life (robotic) that is vastly different than our own and probably more complex. And it is a form of life we would be more likely to send out into space than ourselves, and that is better suited for being send out to other planets than we are. Analogously, imagine a form of alien life unlike that as we know it creating bacterial life and then sending it out in spaceships to populate other worlds. With our form of life being designed by a different form of life and rocketed here, that would be intelligent design of life as we know it.
However, that is NOT what the ID movement holds ID to be: their's is a religious position down to its core, as became even more clear in the Dover, PA court case.
Also, one could argue that Intelligent Design is a fact. When humans create a novel amino acid sequence, or modify a bacterium to perform a specific target function, then we are practicing intelligent design in biology. But that is NOT what the ID movement means. Theirs is a religious position that uses human design as an analogy, not as their goal.
As far as Behe's ID, he made it clear in his Darwins' Black Box and in court in the Dover, PA case that he can't say much of anything about ID. He can't tell WHEN the designs were created, HOW the designs were instantiated, by WHOM or "WHOMS" the designs were created, or WHERE the designs and instantiations occurred. He's got 0 details. Yet he rejects evolution - despite the tons of evidence - because not every single I has been dotted in the origin of the bacterial flagellum. Behe strains out a gnat yet swallows a camel.
