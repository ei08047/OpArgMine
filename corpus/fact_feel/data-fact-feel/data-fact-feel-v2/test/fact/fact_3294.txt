I know that I'm hardly unique in rejecting the pious life that my teachers held up as the ideal: I was quite conscious at the time that I was merely a square peg in a round hole that was being bashed until it fitted. Parroting answers to questions that were themselves irrational wasted an absurd amount of time of course - but in other respects I received a good education for which I am still grateful.
Nice to hear from someone who had a similar experience.
