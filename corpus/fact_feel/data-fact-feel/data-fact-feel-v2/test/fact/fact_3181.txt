Yes, I'd say I do exist (to answer your question). Furthermore, I don't see why Matthew S has a problem with it....he is the one thinking we are "at war" and he states that he is willing to do the same things. I assume he finds this behavior during "a war" to be fairly standard and if the opposite situation had happened he would be all for it.
