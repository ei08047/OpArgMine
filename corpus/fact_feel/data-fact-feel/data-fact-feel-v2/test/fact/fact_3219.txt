Why is there this onus on the man to do everything? As I said before, it is just as much the woman's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case, then it is already covered by rape laws. By your proposition, only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all.
It's not a case that 'the man did the deed' - both parties are potentially just as culpable. If you're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion, they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties; the woman included. 
However, personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion.
