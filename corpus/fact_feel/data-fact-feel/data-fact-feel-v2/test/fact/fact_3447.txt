Yes. It is also a classic example of a creationist straw man. It demonstrates that you haven't bothered to learn the most basic ideas of the topic and that you are willing to let some creationist hack dupe you. The methods of dating fossils was first developed by creationists when they discovered that certain suites of fossils were always found in the same order in geological strata. They reasoned that the deeper the fossils were, the older they were. Thus, they assigned relative ages to certain types of strata. Of course, their estimates of actual age were way off, since they thought that the earth was only a few million years old. We now have several methods of radiometric dating and can more accurately determine the ages of fossils. The relative dating methods of the creationist scientists has been confirmed - the dates are just older than they thought.
