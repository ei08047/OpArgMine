Well said. The truth of the matter is society's desire to hang blame on obvious contributing circumstances rather than attributing anything to developments leading up to and cumulating in that circumstance. Take away guns, knifes, etc. and something will be used, perhaps a deadly spray poison with components and mixing instructions available on the Internet. People will clamor to censor the Internet but distance themselves from social ills or personality defects as the basic, underlying cause.
