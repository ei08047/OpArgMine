That sounds good to me. Although it might be easiest to preserve flow later on it we don't actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive (and inevitably digress) - just let people quote/cite us from this one if needs be. I certainly plan on adding in more off-topic commentary/digressions in the mirror thread (marked in these posts as *, when I remember to).
Incidentally, I hate to be finicky with names, but there's not need to go all-caps with my name - I keep imagining you shouting it! Iangb, iangb or just plain Ian is all good.
