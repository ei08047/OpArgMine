Criminals get guns from strawman purchases. When someone with no criminal record legaly buy a gun to sell to a "friend" with a criminal record.
They people who sell criminals guns do not just do it once, they do it again and again. Some of the guns used in Colombine were obtained this way. The seller knowingly sold them to minors and got less that 6 months in jail.
Many times these people are not even prosecuted, will still have clean records, and will continue to buy and sell guns to "friends".
If your serious about stopping availibility of guns to criminals, then these people should go into the slammer for a long long long time.
