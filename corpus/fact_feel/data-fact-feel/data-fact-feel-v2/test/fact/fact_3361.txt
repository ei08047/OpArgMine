Not if you have permission to do one from the buyer. If I sold a firearm, and didn't know the person so well, I would do one. I have contacts in businesses who can do them for me for free. Its just a smart thing to do. Should it be the law? No way. But I would do it. Better safe than sorry in this instance.
