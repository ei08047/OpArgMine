Yes,
1) It's against Gods Law-an Abomination.
2) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help, just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like. 
3) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer.
