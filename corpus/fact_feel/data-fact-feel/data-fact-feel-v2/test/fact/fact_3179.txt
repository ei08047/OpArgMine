Did you actually read your own links? I was holding those in reserve to prove my comment. Interesting reading non? It seems the wars are repetitious and always involve a tyrant and his government and other wanna be's like Vichy in France capitulating with Hitler. Most of the Free Army was composed of whom? When did the resistance begin and are you making the argument that "resistance is futile" or that resistance is effective?
No doubt Sarge will have some insight on the sitop also?
