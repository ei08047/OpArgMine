Well, scientists in the appropriate fields of science are working on that. I'm not a cosmologist so I rely on scientists in those fields to research those questions. I'm a biologist. I deal with questions of biology, that is living organisms. That is why I am concerned with how living organisms change through time. In other words, that is why I am concerned with evolution. While physicists, cosmologists, geologists and so on may accept evolutionary theory, that doesn't mean that their fields of science are "evolution."
