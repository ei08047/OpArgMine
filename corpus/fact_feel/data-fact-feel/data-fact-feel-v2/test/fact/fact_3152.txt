Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here.
