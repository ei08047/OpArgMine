and she got punished for it
Good thing too because it led to the law being changed. If someone thought drunk driving was an unrighteous law and so they did it and got punished...I don't think you will see much sympathy. It many states that is probably true for abortion.
Why is it unrighteous anyway? Only because you disagree with it :)
