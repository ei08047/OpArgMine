The word subordinate, it will surprise you to learn, is not limited in its application to human social groups. You should check your semantics before you bleat on about words you only partially comprehend. Of course that's never slowed you down in any other context, so keep on bleating and braying. Your problem, not mine. But just for FYI--
"subordinate
adjective
Below another in standing or importance: inferior, junior, lesser, low, lower2, minor, minor-league, petty, secondary, small, subaltern, under. Informal smalltime. See over/under.
In a position of subordination: collateral, dependent, subject, subservient. See over/under, part/whole."
The usage as a value judgement applies here because it rflects the darwinist/materialist attitude towards genes and whole organisms, where genes are given primary importance, especially in evolutionary biology.
The second sense, that of 'contingent' and 'dependent' is strictly a matter of objective classification and is often used in systems studies, and is not confined to human social systems at all. For instance, our moon and sun are subordinate to our sun. See--
"dependent also dependant
adjective
Determined or to be determined by someone or something else: conditional, conditioned, contingent, relative, reliant, subject. See start/end.
In a position of subordination: collateral, subject, subordinate, subservient. See over/under, part/whole."
All of the above at answers.com, and readily available in something that you obviously never use--a thesaurus.
