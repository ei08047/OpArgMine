Oh so then Brady got it all wrong according to the VPC. Funny. Brady says the Brady laws are working quite well. Now they are asking me to trust them that they can make it all right? What is going on here?

OK so if I understand this correctly, the VPC wants to renew a law that according to thier own literature is ineffective, not working, and full of holes?
If your anti-gunner, does this just strike you as wrong?
