The ID movements form of ID states that there are "large gaps" in the theory of evolution that can only be explained by the presence of a supernatural designer. Behe is happy to think that it is the christian god (like the rest of them), but they arn't allowed to say that, because if they do, they violate that annoying ammendment!
The ID argument is not scientific, because it's not falsifiable, and has no supporting evidence. The ID movement relies solely on LACK of evidence for evolution, which is complete bunk. Just because we don't know yet, it doesn't mean that godditit. (Incedentally, most of Behe's claims of "Irreducible Complexity" are already destroyed by science, as DamEtel will be more than happy to explain.)
