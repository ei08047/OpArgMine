Well earlier you seemed interested in the idea that a loophole might exist that allowed people to avoid taxes. In this case I was only suggesting that a loophole could exist which allows companies to save money by hiring gay people instead of straight people in order to cut health insurance costs. As I said, it isn't really a strong argument, but maybe an interesting one.
