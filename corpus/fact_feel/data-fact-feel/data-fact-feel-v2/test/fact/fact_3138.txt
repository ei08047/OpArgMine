This contradicts the fact that logic is an invention born of brain power. If there were no living beings, there would be no logic. There would be plenty to think about but nobody to do any thinking requiring what we know today as logic. Logic is TOTALLY a human construct.
...and since it has nothing at all to do with the existence of God, atheists are just as good at it as the Bible Thumpers. As a matter of fact, I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.
