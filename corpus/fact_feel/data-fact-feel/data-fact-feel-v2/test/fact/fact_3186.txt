Are you suggesting that if abortion were banned that abortion clinics that are already done will flood the US? Please, get real here. People would probably go across the bordor and get abortions there...you might have drugs from canada come over that cause abortion but there is no reason to believe this will "clog" up the jails. People need to realize that is was only 30yrs ago that abortion was pretty much illegal (in most states). Did you see prisons flooded ? no.
