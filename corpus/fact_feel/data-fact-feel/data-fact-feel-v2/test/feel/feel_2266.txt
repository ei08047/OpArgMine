So the "black codes" of the South wasn't enough evidence for you?
The neonazi organizations, even with Hitler long dead, are still a racist, white supremacist, kill any minority you don't like, organization. Time hasn't changed them one bit from one the original nazi party stood for.
If time hasn't changed the nazis, of the KKK, why would time change what gun control was all about; keeping blacks from being able to be truly free?
