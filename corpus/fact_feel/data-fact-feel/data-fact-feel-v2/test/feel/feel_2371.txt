I believe in what I have no evidence to support. That is faith. I do not believe in evolution. The evidence is overwhelming for the educated. As for your "stumbling blocks," they are founded in ignorance. Why don't you educate yourself? You make creationism look foolish.
By the way, what is the problem with Archaeopteryx? I'm sure that you have educated yourself to address the list of features that I gave. I just can't believe that you would speak to the issue and not understand the implications of all of those points that I listed. Were you just a parrot?
It seems that you lack the ganas to even say that you don't know. An example of "creation science" at its best!
