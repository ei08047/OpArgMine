Obviously the correct thing to do is kill the zygote. The thing that bothers me about this whole thing is some of the people that said they would refuse to choose. This is characteristic of your typical wimpy religious copout and is nothing but a cheep avoidance tactic. These people are not the kind of people that should be making any important decisions that concern other people so I guess itâ€™s just as well. A zygote is no more viable then a sperm. The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense.
