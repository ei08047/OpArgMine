Well since you claim they are I simply don't believe you. This coming from the one who can't use much else than dishonest, biased gun grabber groups. I'd add you are a waste of time. I pay as much attention to your demands as I do to knat farts. In fact I'll make it a point to include them.
To sum up your own biased gun grabber group isn't sure exactly where the problem is. Yet even they admit to an enforcement problem. The ATF says its straw purchasers. Not gun owners. Yet you insist its honest people not locking guns up. So far your evidence is scanty to non existant at best. You fail to acknowledge the fault of the criminal element in any way. In short eliminate the criminal from the scene and one could stack guns on the kitchen table safely. Its totally the fault of gun owners for failure to secure. You consistantly fail to acknowledge prior restraint being unconstitutional. It has been demonstrated that your storage idea has led to erosion of civil rights in other countries. Not to mention the very real possiblity of it happening here if your scam is followed. From the gunners seat its nitwits exactly like you in legislature that are the real problem. Now run for the bunker to evade the toxic environment. Your storage scam is shot full of holes.
