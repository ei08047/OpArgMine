oh yeah
rubbish rubbish,
scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at 
conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. 
seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.
