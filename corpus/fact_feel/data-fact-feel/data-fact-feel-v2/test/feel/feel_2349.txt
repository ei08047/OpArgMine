Ok, I'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes.
I really don't like the fact that you brought out, how African Americans, abort because of poverty, and low education. But white people abort for different reasons. 
That is basicly what you said. I find that to be an insult. My cousin, was not poor, nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions. As well as my sister. I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people. Because I never saw you pin a reason, on why white people abort. But in your mind its understandable. But WOE! To the uneducated black folks! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education, and sports provided for them.
By that statement, it seems to me as if you're implying that black people don't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves. Need I remind you, that black people are leading in the sports world. And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning.
And what is your advice for those who are white, who lead uneducated lives, and abort because of being poor. Believe it or not, there are alot in that situation. So don't you dare classify one race. And assume, they are uneducated, and poor. Thus they have abortions. Expecially since I see that with people of all races. It seems to me like you never took that into consideration.
