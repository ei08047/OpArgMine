An abortion is an abortion. Your emotional use of the word "euthanasia" is pointless and irrelevant. Either you object to abortion or you don't. Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.
I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).
Don't like it? ... TOUGH!
And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself.
