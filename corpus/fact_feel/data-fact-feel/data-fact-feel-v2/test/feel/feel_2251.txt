Ironic, since your "Out of China" post was basically the same as this post.
You even claim you had no debate point, you were just posting "information". It wasn't until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate. Maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps...you might give them a little leeway if you, yourself, do this as well. Or are you above the rules of the average forum participant? Hmmm.
