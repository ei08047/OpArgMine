And I believe they should ban religious speech the defame gays or ban religion all together as a public nuisance and protect the public from its drug like effects. I understand, however, that to restrict others freedom of speech of one group today, might mean that my freedom of speech could be restricted tomorrow.
They have the right to free speech even free speech, I or anyone else diagrees with. This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.
Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity. This case now sets Precedent, that if I find religious speech hurtfull, or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people, marriage, or gay rights, I could sue for pain and suffering.
God bless Fred Phelps for giving fundies and religion a black eye. :) Fred Phelps is the one of the best things ever that could happen for gay rights. GO FRED.
