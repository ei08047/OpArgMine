"d00d" (do you really think I do not know how to spell d00d?) I am one of these so called paranoid people... But it is not paranoia it is vigilance. I don't expect any ill to come my way but if it does... well lets say I am "well-regulated"... Should you thank your government overlords to allow you to protect your family with a shotgun as opposed to a FLASH SUPPRESSED carbine? Ever fire a shotgun or rifle not flash suppressed at night? lets just say pray there is only one of them and he got the lead or you'll be running around like mr-magoo while he rapes your wife and steals your government cheese. OH and not so good for the Koreans... Those very same AK's which saved those individuals AND the state millions of dollars can't own those weapons anymore... hmmmm.....
Oh and its not the russians.. Its the jack booted blue helmets that will come knockin when some skirt wearing liberal turns over our soveriegnty to the UN. Don't laugh Klinton tried it.
Standing up screaming the cold dead hands mantra is not extremism. Its called defending the constitution. Personally I usually wear a MOLON LABE! tshirt (Avaliable here when I attend council meetings, at the airport, various functions were the libs tend to hang out... Its a declaration of freedom... Not paranoia.... vigilance not rebellion. 
Get educated.. read Unintended Consequences then reflect on your position. You will see that "reasonable" gun control is not so "reasonable".
BTW you half passed the test.. Personally I would never under ANY circumstance list the weapons or most other property for that matter. Why would you alternate hydrashocks with UMC? besides the supersonic 135gr hydrashock is a much better man-stopper...
