It is?
If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?
Is faith some innate human tendency?
It could be seeing as how there is the "god spot" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.
Then again, kids are scared of the dark...
