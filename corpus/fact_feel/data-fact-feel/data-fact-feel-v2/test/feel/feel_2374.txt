More bull XXXX. 
First, our Creationist seems to forget that many millions of bases in the human genome are nonfunctional. Why would random changes to 3 or 4 of those nucleotides be fatal? They wouldn't.
Besides, our Creationist is trying to make it seem like all of the millions of mutations he references - which is an invalid number - would occur in a single animal?!?!?!??!?! No, the ~1.5 million nucleotide changes in the human lineage (half the nucleotide differences between the chimp and human genomes) would have had about 6 million years to accumulate.
Finally, our Creationists seems to be aware of the fact that humans differ among themselves at about 1 out of every 200 base pairs. By his reasoning, shouldn't we all be dead?
