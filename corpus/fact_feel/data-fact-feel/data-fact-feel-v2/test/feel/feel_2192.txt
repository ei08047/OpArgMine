Oh, I am just so bothered and annoyed that I can't prove my faith!!! Actually, I'm not really that bothered nor annoyed. I know that all the evidence points to creation, i.e. the creation interpretation makes more sense than the evolutionary interpretation. There is very good evidence to suggest the existence of God, for one, the fact that we are all still here is one. If there were no God, than this whole universe would cease to function. I believe the laws of nature and our sciences are man's attempt to describe the normal ways that God upholds His creation. When He acts differently, a miracle occurs. Of course, this is based on the belief that the Bible is true. Many other great scientists, including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible. 
Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly, rational and logical. By the dictionary, reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. Now, if we are accidents of pure chance (which evolution teaches) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. This is just to show that with evolution, you can't be sure of anything, because everything is just an accident. But with an orderly and rational Creator, you can be sure of things and be able to reason.
