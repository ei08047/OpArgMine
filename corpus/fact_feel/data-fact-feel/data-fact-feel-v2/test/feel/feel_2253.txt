Well its not much of a religious debate to me when it comes to free will. I believe the Bible fully supports the idea of free will and even assuming that it says nothing at all, based on the way some things go it is hard to believe a good God would not only allow it to happen, but to make it happen is even worse. I mean, what else is there? If we don't have free will and God is the ultimate power, then he must be the one making decisions for us. Can't blame the Devil for everything. Nah I guess you could, but that wouldn't make God sound too good either if he was letting all of his prized creations have their fake lives destroyed by a demon.
