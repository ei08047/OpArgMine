Really Matt.
I guess you were trying to be funny or ironic, but I don't find it so. I sympathize with your point, of course, but your content comes off a little, well... nuts. You come off sounding more like Archy than you know. Sorry, that's a terrible thing to say to someone, but ...
Simply put, I don't see how this adds any thought to the discussion.
