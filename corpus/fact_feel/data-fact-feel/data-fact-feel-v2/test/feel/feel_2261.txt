Uh... What? This sort of response could only be dreamed up by a religious zealot looking for a reason to oppose atheism. No atheist would ever respond with "I'm the God of my own universe."
Further, the idea that "you have to have standards to these things or being an atheist is irrational" makes no sense. That sentence doesn't even mean anything at all.
Unless this conversation was intended to show two people repeating nonsense to one another, it is useless.
