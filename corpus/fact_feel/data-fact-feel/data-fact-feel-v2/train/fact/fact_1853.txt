Sartre, you know little of history.
Until relatively recently within the history of humankind, the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan--oh, how they loved their males, men were next to God in their eyes, a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church--ruled on the existence of infants within his clan. If he chose, this next to God male, the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance. If he chose not, the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or, perhaps, might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer. In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused, used as a sexual toy--hmmm, kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil. Interesting.
