Well, that is a load of lots of misinformation, and some misconceptions.
The reason that we do have not observed any life coming from non-life is for several reasons. 1) the environment is changed. We no longer have a methane atmosphere that is full of organic matrials. 2) even if some did come, how would we know? If we came accross it, we would assume it was there for a long time.
You are incorrect about dating fossils. One way that fossils are dated is vis radiometric dating. I know answer in geneis has a lot of misinformation (and plain out lies) about radiometiric dating. Here is a link to a web site that explains it, and also answers the critiism of creationists http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html
We have seen 'answers in genesis' many many times. They make a lot of 
invalid asserstoins, and basically are ignorant when ti comes to science. 
Their main arguenent consist of misrreprenting the viewpoint of science,
the logical fallaciy of personal incredibilty, and the logical fallacy of the arguement from ignorance.
