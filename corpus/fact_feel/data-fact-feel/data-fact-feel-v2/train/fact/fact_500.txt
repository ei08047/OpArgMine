The redundant 0.3GHz version was replaced by a serial 0.7GHz upgrade which ironed out most of the problems of the older model. I don't know if anyone else had the .3, it always used to give you the 'hibernation error at line 20...insert more berries' message and then turn blue and refuse to budge.
Still, the thing was with the .3 bear, you could really get under the bonnet and fiddle about. I customized mine from a European Black to a Grizzly - new fur job and everything. The .7 was essentially designed for XXXXXX. Sure it didn't crash as often but when it did there was nothing you could do but wheel it down to Bear Repairs and pay an extortionate amount for a new muzzle and a set of claws.
I moved over to a stoat in '94. Not as much software available but sooo much more reliable.
Has anyone seen the Nobel list yet this year. I have a hunch we'll be seeing Supersport on it. His workis really blowing evolution out of the water...
