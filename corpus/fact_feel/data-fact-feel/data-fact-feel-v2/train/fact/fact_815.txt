I'll ask the question that needs to be asked.
If France qualifies as a "developed nation" as we've been lead to believe, why did the homeowner have to resort to getting close enough that he could strangle the burglar?
Surely if you're a developed nation, you're not going to force your own people to put themselves in harms way while they're in the process of saving themselves, right?
