Again, I did not say that they did not recommend abortion... they do offer it as an option, but I have never heard of anyone being 'forced' to have one by Planned Parenthood. All I was disputing was when you said that they ALWAYS recommended it. They do offer pregnancy counseling, along with pregnancy testing. They also offer birth control, gynecological care, STD testing, infertility testing, sexual education counseling, prenatal care, adoption referrals.. etc...Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor, and probably most other doctors as well. They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks. If an ob/gyn sees an ultrasound with severe problems, they will sometimes recommend an abortion too.
All in all, I just thought that your remark that Planned Parenthood always recommended an abortion was wrong. They also offer services to men too, do you think they recommend abortion to them as well??
I have nothing wrong with you being pro-life... I honestly don't. I think it's good that you stand up for what you believe in. But when you make a statement on how a woman is wrong to have an abortion even if her own life is in danger, I find that a little ignorant. I'm not saying that you are ignorant yourself, but I don't think you are as well informed on everything as you seem to think you are.
And can I ask, are you male? If you are, you will never, ever be in any type of situation like that, so how can you decide what a woman should do when SHE is faced with a situation?
