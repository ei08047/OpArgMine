If private firearms were to be made illegal across the board, I suggest to you the civil unrest you speak of would be epidemic in our nation. The US, as it has stood constitutionally for 215 years, though wobbly at times, would cease to have existed, as envisioned by the founders of our country, and having been sacrificed for by so many brave men and women. That is my opinion, and of course, may not be shared by many.
