First off, I think NATO had a pretty good point. What makes you think that every person shot was a pure victim?
Second, is that why crime rates have gone down in DC after Heller vs DC and why they went down after Florida Shall Issue laws were reinstated?
I'm guessing thats also why New York City and Chicago have such low crime rates, right? emoticonXRolleyes
