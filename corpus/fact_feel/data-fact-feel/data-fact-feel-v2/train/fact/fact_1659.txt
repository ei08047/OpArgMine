So we kill the baby instead? Interesting idea. How about instead we reform the fostor and adoption care system. No, people arn't looking for healthy, white infants, they are looking for infants. This automatically reduces 90% of adoption cases. The so called "Healthy white infants" make up 70% of all adoption cases, seeing that 30% of abortion are done by blacks, and latinos and most minorities don't have abortions, but instead keep their children.
