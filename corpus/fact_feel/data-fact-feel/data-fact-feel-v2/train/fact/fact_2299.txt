Certainly... just like how the makers of Expelled have repeatedly refused to publish the interviews in full. It's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled don't want them to be able to object in the first place. It's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he hasn't even seen the movie. They can't pull that one on Dawkins anymore, which is to their disadvantage, but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late.
