murder would violate the common law.
People should be free to do as they please, but an employer should also be free to employ who they see fit.
we are not talking about legalized beatings.
And are you... now saying being gay is a belief system?
or are they born that way?
which is it?
personally, i would never agree to discriminate against people for being gay..
however... if they are flaboyantly gay... then i do favor discrimination.
there is no need to flaunt it.. as it disturbs people.
but if they act normal.. speak normal.. and seem normal, then there would be no justification for firing them in my book.
