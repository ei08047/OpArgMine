That's nonsense. When Darwin was at the University of Edinburgh studying medicine, he spent more time studying zoology and geology. His teachers were some of the most respected scientists of the day. Later, when he was at Christ's College, Cambridge studying divinity in preparation entry into the seminary, he actually spent more time studying botany and natural science, under John Henslow (a mineralologist and botanist). Darwin later studied with Adam Sedgwick (a geologist). Both men were leading scientists in their field of the day (both taught at Cambridge). Henslow became a lifelong friend of Darwin and it was his recommendation that gained Darwin the position aboard the Beagle. By the way, both men were ordained in the Chruch of England.
