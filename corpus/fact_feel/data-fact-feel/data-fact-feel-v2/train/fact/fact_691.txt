I agree that all other reasonably safe options (such as caesarian delivery, in womb operations, etc.) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester. As with the example of the friend of jitobear, sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures.
As for the question of limits on the health exception, yes, the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother's death or complete debilitation. However, there is also a gray region that I am undecided on.
For example:
- What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm?
- What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20% chance of paralysis?
The gray region is harder to quantify and the moral balance gets trickier. Perhaps that is why this issue hasn't really been addressed specifically in law. Where decisions in morally gray regions are concerned, it is too easy to criticize them and politically unwise to venture into that territory.
