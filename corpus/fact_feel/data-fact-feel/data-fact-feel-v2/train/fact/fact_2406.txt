first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them.
