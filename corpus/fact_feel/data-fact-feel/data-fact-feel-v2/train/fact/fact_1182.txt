You know that under most public healthcare systems you can still buy private care if you really want to, don't you?
As for OldSarge's claim of bean pushers deciding what care you get, isn't another name for them "claims adjustors"? When I go to see a doctor he's the one who decides my treatment, not anyone else. He doesn't have to call anyone to check the funding is there, if it's covered for anyone, it's covered for me as well.
