The problem lies in the choice of theory. Evolutionary theory is one of our strongest theories. It has bucket-loads of evidence to support it. It is very well understood. Gravitational theory however is a woefully weak theory. Beyond the facts that mass has no effect upon the rate of descent, we can send probes to Saturn's moons using our knowledge of gravity and gravity effects time, we know next to diddly squat about it. We do not know how it works. It doesn't even appear to work properly over large siatnces, the universe is expanding at the wrong rate according to our gravitational calculations, we invent dark matter and dark energy (neithe rof which has been detected) to explain gaping hole sin the theory and the entire theory is at odds with quantum theory. So why don't Kansas shcools teach about alternate theories in physics classes when covering gravity?
The answer of course is simple: evolution is questioned to appease the religious fundamentalists that still hold your country to ransom by the balls. Don't give me this nonsense about "evolutionist zealots": they are simply scientists p***ed off with weak school boards cowering at the the first sign of the fundies getting upset over their kids being taught current scientific knowledge, rather than religious mythology, in science classes. ID is religious mythology. It has no evidence to support it. It isn't a scientific theory. It has no place in the science classroom.
