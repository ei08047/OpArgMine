Not really, this case was different in that the state was the guardian. Although I am sure it has happened before. 
As for three reasons...
1) The state of Florida doesn't believe a 13 yr old can have sex (consent) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion?
2) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and can't go as a parent would be able to do....and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics.
3) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID. Maybe that doesn't matter for most :-/
