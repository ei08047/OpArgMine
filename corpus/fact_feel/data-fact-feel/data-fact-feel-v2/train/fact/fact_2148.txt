This is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise Peddlar, that things can happen over time? Not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one, there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected. DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do.
There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime.
