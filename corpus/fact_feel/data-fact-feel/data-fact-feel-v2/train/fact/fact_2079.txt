"What is true, Ricker says, is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals, and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. "
The quote says it all. That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility. Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity.
GM and Ford know that 100% of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products.
Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes.
There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that. That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF. The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries. The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals, but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity. Which is the position of every single product manufacturer not matter what you make and sell.
It is not that gun manufactures are looking away, they do. So does every other manufacture who makes any other product.
