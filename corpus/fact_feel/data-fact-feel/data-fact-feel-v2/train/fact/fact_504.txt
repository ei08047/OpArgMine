A specific age is picked because it occurs sometime and there is no way to know in any specific individual whether their pre-frontal cortex is up to snuff or not. There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis. If this occurs (I think it's clear that it does) and if this is a rational reason for treating persons differently (that is, of course, arguable) then the line must be drawn somewhere. 
I was wrong to say 18 is arbitrary. I misused the word. I would assume that most people have a mature CNS by that age, so that is why it is picked. The objective evidence of this is done looking at populations, not individuals. 
Subjectively, anyone who has kids will know that a young teen's judgement is pretty bizarre at times.
