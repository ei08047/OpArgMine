Please explain to me how radiometric dating is based on the presupposition that there is no God. You're telling me that if there was/is a God the results of radiometric dating change? 
Abiogenesis is not scientific theory, and for good reason. Like you said it just has no evidence. That's why it is considered a hypothesis. It is one of many including creation, which was taught in my public high school. I have no problem with this, but the problem becomes when it is taught as a fact or as a valid alternative to evolution. As long as the truth is taught, that there is really no proof for either abiogenesis or creation, I'm fine. But this debate is whether or not Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution.
