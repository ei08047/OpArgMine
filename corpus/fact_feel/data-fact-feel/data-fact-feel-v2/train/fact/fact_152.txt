Actually, natural selection is usefull as well as higher maths. It's knowledge. If you want to go around like a bumbling fool all of your life...no, then it's not useful. Any education is useful and beneficial, given that it's objective and real--not fantasy religion. Tons of people use higher math. Engineers, mathematicians, medical field..military... etc. No, it's not useful for the common virginia mountain-fur trader.
Natural Selection is important in any biological field. To say it's useless is absurd, for it's one of the prime foundations for ALL of Biology.
