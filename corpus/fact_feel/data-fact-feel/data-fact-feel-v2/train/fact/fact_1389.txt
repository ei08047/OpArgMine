This is an answer based on either BS or ignorance.
Those without money can use Medicare or Medicaid to virtually pay for the entire pregnancy. WIC also supplements your own feeding IIRC with proteins and calcium products. I've known several people (including hard core conservatives) who've had to go this route 'because they couldn't afford a pregnancy'. And if your morality/ ethics prevents you from taking gov't funding, think of it as stuff you already paid for with taxes (now and later), you're just getting some of what you put in back.
Furthermore, there are several agencies that would easily pay for all your needs provided you put the child up for adoption.
