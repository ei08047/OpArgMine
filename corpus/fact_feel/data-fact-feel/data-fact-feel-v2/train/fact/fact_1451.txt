Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?
And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.
