Without a doubt Peter is my favorite in the NT.
Acts 2 is a shocking turn of events, when on the day of Pentecost 3,000 believed in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, and were saved and received the power of the Holy Spirit.
Truly God used the lowest and most worthless and in Peter's lowest, God used the occassion for the highest Good. And, at the end of his life, he asked to be cruicified upside down (a merciful request, BTW) - who could make this scenario up?
Why would 3,000 Jews believe in a dead Messiah? Why was the tomb empty? If Jesus was not the Messiah, who could believe the Gospel?
Why would anyone risk being a Jewish heretic, and being cast out of Jerusalem? Acts 7 if memory serves me, or 8,9 as the believers in "The Way" - Jews for Jesus as it were, were expelled from Jerusalem.
Some did stay behind with James, who was later beheaded 40 - 50 A.D. or so. More for tomorrow.......L8r, Rich
