the problem with a "un-genesis style" creation is that it would effectively nullify everything in the bible. the biblical god both created life on earth in 6 days and sent his son to die for the sins of humankind. to me there is something very wrong with blatantly rejecting one biblical claim and blindly embracing another
the god in this context (one that created the world some other way, and may not necessarily disapprove gays) may also not care about your ethical code. then such a god's existence should have no bearing on how we live our lives, now would it?
if such a god requires us to be ethical, is not against homosexuality, and created the world in a way other than genesis' description, then you are talking about a god of specific characteristics that would lend itself to a precise definition. we would require a lengthy list of rules by which we should live, and a description of how the world was actually created, as well as historical references of god's interaction with mankind in times past. you'd end up with another bible
