Can you tell us what you would accept as "proof"?
You can be shown any number of transitional sequences that demonstrate evidence, but the level of evidence needed for your own personal "proof" is up to you.
Proof is for mathematics, science works by evaluating competing theories using evidence and eliminating those which do not predict observed results.
