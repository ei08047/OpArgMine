Well, actually there is. Bat wings for example are one of the easier problems for evolution to solve (we can even see potential transitional stages in other animals like the flying squirrel). The co-option of existing structures is the bread and butter of evolution. Now, if bats and birds had four legs and wings, that would be more of a head-scratcher.
