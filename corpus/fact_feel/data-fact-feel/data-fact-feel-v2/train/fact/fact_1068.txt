I'm not even going to comment on the '6000 years old' statement.
As to predicting the orbits of planets, it's simple. Due to the laws of gravity, planets go in regular circular or elliptical paths. By observing a planet for a period of time and making measurements, you can find out mathematically how that planet moves, how long it takes to complete one orbit, where that orbit lies, how fast it moves e.t.c.
