Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.
For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.
On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.
