You think wrong. Just look at most places in Scandinavia. They are much freer in thier atitude towards sex and they don't have nearly the the problems as you do. Of course that is on a per capita basis. 
No, it is ignorance of sex that is the problem in this situation. In the case of many places in the USA it is sort of like "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing..."
