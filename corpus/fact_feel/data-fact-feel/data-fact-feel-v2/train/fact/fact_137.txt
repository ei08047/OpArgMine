There's more to the adoption of an atheistic stance than just rejecting the bible because it's scientifically false. 'The bible is scientific nonsense, therefore there is no god' is not a logical stance.
Modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures, past and present, and the consequent improbability that just one of them (and hey, waddaya know? It's mine!) is wholly true and all the others wholly false. This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths.
