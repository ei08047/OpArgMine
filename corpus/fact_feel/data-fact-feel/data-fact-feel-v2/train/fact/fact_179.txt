Let's take this slowly...
a) Montalban is asked to give a definition of unknowables, and does so
Mach: It's illogical, merely defining it doesn't prove it exists.
b) Mach is asked to show a scientific test for dark
Mach: Look I don't have a scientific test for dark, but I can prove it exists by giving a definition of it!
Once again you defy yourself! So, merely defining 'darkness' does not prove it exists BY SCIENCE. What you have done is to confirm that it can't be defined BY SCIENCE.
SHOW ME THE SCIENCE THAT DEFINES DARKNESS. If you can't then we have evidence for a suggestion that something exists (in nature) that science can't test for.
