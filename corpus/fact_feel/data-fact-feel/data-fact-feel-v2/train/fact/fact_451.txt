Would make, that is. However, not all members of the population are able to breed.
Should we make this a thread for posting examples of natural selection? That might be fun.
An example: rats are often a problem. The solution? Introduce rat poison.
Unfortunately, some rats are immune to the poison. You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce, and the others don't (as much).
Another: elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes (attracting mates). Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks.
However, when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks, the elephants with smaller tusks (or no tusks) reproduce more.
