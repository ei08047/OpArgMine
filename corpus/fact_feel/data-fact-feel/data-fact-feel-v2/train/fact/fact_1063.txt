You are arguing from US law, I am arguing from Australian law. I think I needed to state this at the beginning.
I have not heard of a US court case where a woman sued a hospital for bringing her back to life 'against her will'. Though in America, anything is possible
The oath of a doctor is to save a life. A woman who OD'ed would need to be saved.
