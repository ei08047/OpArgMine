I've seen no solid evidence to prove there's an actual connection between guns and testosterone levels. Just more of your correlation/causation bull****. One could easily argue that those with naturally higher than average testosterone levels would want to hold a gun more than they would a stupid child's toy.
Millions of people are carrying guns every day, and they're not having hostile encounters with other people. Not even in high stress situations. That kind of blows your "study" out of the water.
Try again.
