the only thing i see that would be a NFA would be the "Semi-automatic pistol with A folding, telescoping or thumbhole stock"
of corse having a stock means it is not a pistol, but a SBR, but why let facts stop them.
i wpnder if the bb guns that you put the bb in a plastic cartrage would quilifie as an assalt rifle if this passes.
