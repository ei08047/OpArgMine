Your assumption that the parents are less mature than the child is equally as ludicrous as your claim that a 14 year old is mature enough to make this decision before she is old enough to sign ANY LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT, and that includes 15, 16 and 17 year olds. They are still below the age of consent so the issue should be moot. 
But unfortunately, in this day and age when parents are becoming more like caretakers rather than moral guides, it is only a matter of time before they lose all authority over their child's decisions to the State.
