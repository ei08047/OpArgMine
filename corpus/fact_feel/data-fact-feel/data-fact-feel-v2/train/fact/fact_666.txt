Well, again, the best resource I could think of is wikipedia, just do a few searches there (I suggest starting with "Human evolution") and I'm sure most of your questions will be answered. Bear in mind though that even this will only give you a basic overview. If you really want to go in depth, take a college course on evolution. Another good site would be TalkOrigins Archive: Exploring the Creation/Evolution Controversy
