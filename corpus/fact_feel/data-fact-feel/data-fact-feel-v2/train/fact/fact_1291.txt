I think the real question is not detaching but killing. You don't detach a fetus during an abortion..you just kill the fetus (or embryo) and suck it out. I am not sure Tom is for any of that.
But if Tom would die, then no...Bob has no right to detach...in fact, probably no right even if he wouldn't die.
