Let me clear this up for you.
Wasteful DEFENSE spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the "war on terror." Which by the way has nothing to do with the $200b+ we have spent so far in Iraq (which is by no means the war on terror). 
The entire budget of the EPA is only $7b? I would have thought it was more than that. (That would be 15% of the increase in the defense budget from 2002 to 2003 according to this page:
