Yet, tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll. Regardless, in his report it was a minor point. From a realistic standpoint, it took nothing away from the report when he removed it. 
Lott was investigated for this, just like Bellisiles. He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct (unlike Bellesiles). When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together, the folks investigating him didn't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn;t remeber the details of where that number came from. 
Again, though, he ended up removing that number from his report (the single place that it appeared) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it.
Here is how he responded to the article you link to :

It is rather interesting, and well documented. It addresses a couple of inacuracies in the article, such as the misconseption that he had attributed the disputed numner to Kleck.
