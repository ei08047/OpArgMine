Sounds anti-government to me. Are you against your President's economic policies, the fed, bureacracy and tee poor public education?
Sounds probably who SEIU should have directed their gall toward and not a man's personal property and family...with the police help of course and purloined school busses. Do the taxpayers owe the SEIU anything? Nope but the SEIU according to CNN owes more than 90 million along with 4 million in interest. Perhaps if they paid their bills they wouldn't add to the public debt by using government property to protest government policy?
You wrote it but didn't understand what you wrote...darn public schools emoticonXGood
