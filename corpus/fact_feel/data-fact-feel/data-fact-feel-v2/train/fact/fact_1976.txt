Here you're just flagrantly wrong. For info on the link between dinosaurs and birds, as an example, please follow this link and see the excellent post by pandion on this topic. And before we address the Big Bang, I should point out that the validity of that theory really has nothing to do with evolution. As for proof of it, we have the expanding universe around us, and the theory also predicts the same levels of cosmic background radiation that we actually see everywhere. Could there be other explanations? Possibly. But the Big Bang is still the best we've got.
