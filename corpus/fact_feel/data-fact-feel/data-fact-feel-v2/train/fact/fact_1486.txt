Actually, I'm not looking for shootouts at all with the criminal element. But what is crazy in my opinion, is admitting that there are holes in the system that allow criminals to get automatic weapons illegally, and you see the solution as banning automatic weapons from being purchased by law abiding citizens rather than screaming for the holes in the system to be fixed so the criminals can't get them. It seems to me that you have an anti-gun agenda and will use any flaw in the system as an excuse to ban all guns for all people. Is that a fair assessment of where you stand?
