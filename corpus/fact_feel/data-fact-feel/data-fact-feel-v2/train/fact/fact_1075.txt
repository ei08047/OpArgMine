Science is more than a methodology. Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology. If science were nothing more than a methodology, than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently.
However, you are right, in so far as 'science' _should not_ be conflated with and confused for any particular philosophy, with the possible exception of empiticism. But 'should' is not the issue. The fact is that, falsely and irrationally, you and other materialist have tried, and with great success unfortunately, to convince the public that your materialism and 'science' are one and the same. Just denying that you have done so, and that you [and your fellow darwinists] continue to do so in your every post, doesn't cut the mustard.
