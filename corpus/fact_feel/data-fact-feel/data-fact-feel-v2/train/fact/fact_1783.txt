Again I have to correct you. Dark moths were not observed before 1848. Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moths both in Europe and in the United States. Merely claiming that there was no change is ducking the question. You didn't bother to inform yourself of the facts and now you return to your incorrect assertion again and again after having been informed of your error.
