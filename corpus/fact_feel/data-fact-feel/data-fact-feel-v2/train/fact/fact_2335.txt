The "truth" about atheism is that it's the only proposition that makes sense (apart from agnosticism ?) to people who conclude, as I do, that religious principles are not based on reason.
I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with "divine service", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, "Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !" , and I had received no such gift. 
Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist.
