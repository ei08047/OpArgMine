(there is a lot at the above site that I don't agree with - I use it because I feel that the best place to get an undisputed description OF the opposition is FROM the opposition)
Studies of the origin of the first life form, the origin of the earth, and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design. Of the several "different scientific diciplines" refered to above, they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design, and that's undirected, random, happenstance processes. For purposes of this debate, can we come up with one general two word phrase for the "different scientific diciplines" - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design, which "theory of evolution" is clearly not? How about "happenstance origins"? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit. Does "happenstance origins" fit the same criteria? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design, there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins. If intelligent design isn't repeatable, happenstance origins aren't repeatable. Other scientists can't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist, and on and on. Evolutionists imply that with time, they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins. That's no more (or less) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design. If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science, why can't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science? 
I've never been to college, but here are some comments from someone who has, on the definition of science;
