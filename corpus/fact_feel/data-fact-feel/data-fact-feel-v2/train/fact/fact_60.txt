You're off on the wrong argument, clearly stated above is the issue of an indivudal pharmacists refusing service, a service that the pharmacy offers. If the employee picks and chooses who to service, based on religious reasons, it looks in black and white to violate the law, state and federal:
The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to "full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin."  
Are you suggesting that's not how the law reads? Or are you still attacking the straw man you set up i.e. forcing a pharmacy to stock specific goods....which is indeed ridiculous, both to bring up and to defend, neither of which I'm doing.
The law will of course be interpereted, as will the actions of indivudals, but it's clear that if discrimination is involved on the basis of religion, it is a legal issue.
