Well, I'm basing it first and formost on the states which passed ammendments banning same-sex marriage. The percentages in those states were almost completely lower than 80%, with perhaps one or two exceptions. This indicates that even in the least supportive states, 80% is usually too high a number. Unfortunately, I cannot come up with a good website that lists all of the percentages, but you should be able to look around. This was the least important thing I wrote in that entire post, so I'm not too worried about it.
