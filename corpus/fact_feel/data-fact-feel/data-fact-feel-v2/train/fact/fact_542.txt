You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.
The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was "standing on principle." Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view.
