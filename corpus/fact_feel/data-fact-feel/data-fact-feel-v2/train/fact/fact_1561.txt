I don't know about capuchins, and I am not going to a website. However, I have read just about everything Jane Goodall has written, and I do not see chimps as being "just". They willing hunt down old friends and kill them ( or help to kill them). In the Passion (name of a chimp - Jane named hers) case, the female monkey deliberately found other female members of her own tribe when they were alone and too far away for the others to hear cries of help, and with the help of her children ripped the babies from their mothers and proceded to eat them in front of the mothers. Then as if they had done nothing wrong they would go up and touch the mother "lovingly".Some people can say these show human traits (Jane does), however, while it is common for animals to kill and feel no remorse for it, many humans feel horrible remorse even if they were not directly responsible for killing another human. Some even feel remorse for killing animals. Whether you agree they are human traits or not, you must agree that most humans have some sense of justice. I do not see that sense of justice in all of Jane's research.
