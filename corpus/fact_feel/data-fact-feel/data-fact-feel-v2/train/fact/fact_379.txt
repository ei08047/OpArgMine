The only arguement I hear from these links against embryonic stem cell research is that, in ten years, it hasn't yielded sufficient results for human trials. If that is your only arguement against its scientific viability then it is a weak one. Many technologies, biological ones included, can take a long time to develop. 
Certainly, the adult repair stem cells that are mentioned in your articles may have their uses and sound as if they also deserve research money. However, one cannot just listen to one side of the story to make a decision. The scientists researching repair stem cells, patients who benefited from them, and doctors who use them are obviously going to sing its praises when it does introduce some gain. However, the embryonic stem cells might have even more potential, given the time and money to develop the technology.
So, unless you can show me evidence that embryonic stem cells will never achieve their potential or that repair stem cells can achieve everything that embryonic stem cells are hoped to achieve, then your arguement against embryonic stem cell research continues to be unconvincing.
