The biggest for our local LE. Our sheriff says almost all of his federal funding is tied one way or another to marijuana with almost zip for crystal meth, the current problem drug. And every local LE person I know doesn't consider marijuana a dangerous drug.
What's funny is our state government outlawed over-the-counter sale of some of the primary ingredients for cooking crank in an effort to combat it on the cheap. Yep, all those ingredients are now smuggled in, reducing local retail revenue and we've also experienced an increase of cheap Mexican crank on the street.
Interestingly enough, OR is a state that allows personal pot cultivation for medicinal purposes by MD prescription. As those prescription holders are on record, DEA makes regular inspection rounds of their residences to make sure they aren't exceeding the legal limit of six mature and six immature plants. LE tax dollars at work. Everyone wonders how long it will be before the feds attempt invoking the sleazy interstate commerce catch-all to eliminate that states right. Since Ashcroft the Evangelist is no longer driving dark ages federal moral legislation, maybe there's a chance that won't happen.
