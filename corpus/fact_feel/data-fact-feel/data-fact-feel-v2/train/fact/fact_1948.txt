Yep life is sometimes incredibly fine tuned. Create and maintain an oddball environment and some existing species will move in or if there is no existing species which can use the environment something may well eventually evolve to do so. Microbes are incredibly efficient at this because of their short generation times. So are things like nematodes etc.
