You interpret my request that you follow the rules and post a link, flocking here in utter dismay on my part? How consistently irrational of you jason. Anyway, it seems that you are celebrating prematurely at this point since Congress must approve this move before it's a done deal.
DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage
(AP) – 4 hours ago
WASHINGTON — Washington D.C.'s City Council has voted to legalize gay marriage in the nation's capital.
Mayor Adrian Fenty has promised to sign the bill, which was co-sponsored by 10 of the council's 13 members. The final vote Tuesday was 11-2.
The bill now goes to Congress, which has final say over the district's laws. Opponents say they'll try to get Congress or voters to overturn it.
Passage of the bill is a victory for gay marriage supporters, who have been dealt a recent string of defeats in Maine, New York and New Jersey.
Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. New Hampshire will begin issuing licenses in January.
If Congress doesn't reject the bill, D.C. should start issuing marriage licenses around St. Patrick's Day.
