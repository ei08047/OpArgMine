Oh...and DOOD is spelled Dude.
And I was pointing out that these paramilitary militia types are what gives the anti-gun control argument a bad name. Good for the Koreans. You have the right to protect yourself, sure...but some people take this to extremes. (Maybe we will call them...extremists..yeah thats it) The people who stand up loudly screaming "the only way you'll ever get my gun is by to pry it from my cold dead fingers..." News for you. The way a lot of these militia types act, the general public fears them. This fear is doing more harm to the gun movement than anything else. I'm not talking about someone who has a shotgun by his bed ready for John Q. Criminal to walk in, I keep my .40 by my bed. I'm talking about anti-government militia types who think that they will one day be fighting Russians from their doorstep. You said something about my "phobic rant"? Have you ever heard these paranoid people?
