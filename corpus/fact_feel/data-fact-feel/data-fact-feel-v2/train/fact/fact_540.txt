Yes. For example, the hawthorn maggot fly was observed to change into the apple maggot fly in only a few years. I also gave the example of the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull that exists as a single, continuous population the circles the globe in which the extremes have become seperate species.
Of course, what you are asking is if it has ever been observed that a frog turned into a lion. But that isn't evolution. In fact, a saltation (that is the word for that silly idea) would disprove the current theory of evolution. Organisms change only a little from generation to generation. Generally, evolution is a slow process since it happens in populations, not individuals. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of the entire population of over generations.
