What makes you think I am using “them” as a source? I would suggest you read the story you “read about” again. It is Nathanson, not “people”, who makes the claim. However saying someone lied and proving that they did are two entirely different things. Nathanson said they lied…he hasn’t proved it as such.
Secondly, the figures you speak of that were supposedly based on lies is only exclusive to after the 1950s. We are talking about the 1930s. 
Lastly, using figures after the 1940s is highly skewed; therapeutic abortion was pretty much Roe v Wade lite and eliminated the use of criminal abortion in the middle and upper classes. 
Now, lets get to the facts. Our overall abortion rate was 22.9 in 1996 according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In 1930, Hamiliton published the rate of abortion in 1930 in specific social and economic groups in, “Some Sociologic and Psychologic Observations on Abortion.” The abortion rate in those of the upper/middle class was 24.3, for poor unmarried white women it was 64% and for minorities the abortion rate was 40%. 
So women were aborting probably about a third of their pregnancies in the 1930s. Stix’s, “A Study of Pregnancy Wastage” puts the abortion rate at 35 percent or 35 abortions per 100 live births.
