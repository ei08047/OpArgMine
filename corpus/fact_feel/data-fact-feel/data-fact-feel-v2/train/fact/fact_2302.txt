Well, no, it doesn't. That's sort of the point of the article I linked to. No organismic response, no hypermutable state (apart from one coincidentally arising in a minority of the adaptive population), no EAM.
L&D, as an experiment, had its limitations, namely the lethality of the selective environment. What the article I linked to demonstrates is that Cairns&Foster also has limitations. Most of the time, it should be remembered, the C&F methodology yields the same results as L&D; the circumstances yielding the anomalous results that were a temporary shot-in-the-arm for Lamarckism were very particular. The bacteria had to possess a leaky allele that still operated at a low efficiency, and that functionality had to be just barely inhibited by scavenger cells.
C&F still did something useful: it highlighted the potential importance of amplification mutagenesis, where genes that do a slightly useful job accumulate under selection, increasing the chances that a more successful variant of the gene will arise within any given population.
I'll check out the other experiment you mention; thanks for clearing that up.
