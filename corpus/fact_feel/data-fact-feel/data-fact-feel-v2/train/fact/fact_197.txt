Ah, IIDB stands for Internet Infidels Discussion Board. It's a board similar to this one, only a large portion of the posters there are actual professionals in fields like evolutionary biology, etc (I beleive we have a few scientists and teachers here - I'm a Geological Engineer myself, but not even close to the large amount of experts there). It's really a good place to educate yourself in evolution and various other fields (I know I've learned a lot there). There are also plenty of other subjects (similar to the Religion and other sections on here). If you want to check it out, it's at http://http://iidb.org/vbb/index.php
