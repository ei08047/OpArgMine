The documents contained in the bible are historical artifacts. They reflect the beliefs and values of the people who wrote them. When we read Paul we might not believe everything he says but overall we can believe that he preached a gospel that Jesus was born, crucified, died, and risen. We can discern his message from the 7 or so letters we know of his. 
We can generally believe that he met people named Peter, James, and John who were "reputed to be pillars" and "seemed to be important." We know that he claimed his knowledge of Jesus came through revelation and scripture and claimed that other apostles had similar sources of knowledge. I think we can trust Paul's claims on these things. Do we need to believe he really had revelations? I don't know. Maybe in his own way he did. I think we need to lean toward Paul believing in the truth of his claims.
I would think the court would think very dimly of the hearsay claim that 500 anonymous people had a revelation of the Risen Christ.
