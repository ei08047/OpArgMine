Personally, I don't have a problem with a single thing you said.
You made your CHOICE, and we in the Pro-Choice camp respect your right to choose.
Now, just don't go around trying to impose your choice (which I personally think is perverted and sexist) on the women in my family.
You have the obligation to respect their choices just as we respect yours.
BTW, please tell Gush Limpbutt that there is a world of difference between human, i.e, possessing the right genes, and personhood, which begins at birth.
