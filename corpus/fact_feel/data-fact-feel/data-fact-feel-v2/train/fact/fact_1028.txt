The problem is that there is no test the staff can administer to determine love. They can't tell if someone is really a loved one, or just some freak off the street that gets off on looking at unconscious people. Restricting access to family members is not an inherently bad idea, but it must include in its definition of family same sex couples. And since the only way to guarantee that definition is legally, what we have here is one more reason why gays should be allowed to get married.
