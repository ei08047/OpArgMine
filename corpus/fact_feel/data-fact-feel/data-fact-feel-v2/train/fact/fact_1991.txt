In reverse? The scientific method begins with an observation. Then an hypothesis is proposed that will explain the observation. Then a prediction is made that must be true as a consequence, if the prediction is correct. Then methods are devised to test the prediction. What is described in the paper is the last step. Majerus already has his hypothesis and his prediction and is accumulating the data that will support them.
