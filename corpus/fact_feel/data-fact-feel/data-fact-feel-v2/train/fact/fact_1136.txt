If all you got in school was that the Spanish Inquisition was "at times very strict" than you have been a wee bit undereducated to put it mildly. Let me give you the cliff notes version- the purpose of the Spanish Inquisition was to find anyone who didn't believe exactly what the Church told them to and if they were found to be "heretics," they were gruesomely tortured until they said they believed, or if they didn't they were killed.
Now I hope you can see why saying the Spanish Inquisition was "at times very strict" is a GIGANTIC understatement.
