The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. 
Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:
"It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union "to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS."

We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia.
