Can you say run-on sentence? I knew you could!
It seems that we have another scientific illiterate (as well as another English semi-literate). Before you talk about science, learn what it is and how it works. Science does not "prove" things. It explains them. Science is the investigation of natural phenomena through observation, theoretical explanation, and experimentation, or the knowledge produced by such investigation.
How is it that you think that rocks that were once bones are not old. Are you not aware that fossils are not the preserved remains of organisms? The organic materials have been replaced by minerals and they are rock. Ever actually see a fossil? Ever actually hold one?
