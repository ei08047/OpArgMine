In all fairness the Pharmacist does serve an important vetting role in the supply of medication to patients- they check what has been prescribed by the doctor against they know about and correct errors that are made (which do happen... I was once given a 7 week course of anti-malarials which turned out to be suitable for taking no more than 28 days at a time).
That aside I'd agree with sinjin.
