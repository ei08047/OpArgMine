Back in 1999 when they removed macro evolution from the curriculum requirements, they did so because their science advisory board, a board composed of college professors from our state colleges, including a couple of folks who are cinsidered some fo the top biologists in the world, told them unanimously that while macro evolution was the best theory we currently have, it may be wrong. Apparently while there is a huge amount of data and emprical evidence to support micro evolution, the same body of evidence does not necessarily prove macro evolution.
Panion is simply a zealot on the other side of the issue from the YEC folks. He/She sees gloom and doom for anybody that dares approach the theory. This kind of thinking is what sets us back to the middle ages. If we do not present the holes and weak spots in the theory, how are they ever going to be filled?
