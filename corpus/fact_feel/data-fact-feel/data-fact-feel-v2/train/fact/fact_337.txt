Well, evolution says that everything evolved over "millions of years", correct? Let's say it takes a certain species 1 million years to evolve. That means that every 100 years of its "evolving process" we should be able to see 1,000 mutations! In the last 100 years, what SPECIES have we seen evolve 1,000 times? (Into an entirely new species, no less.)
