You are missing the fact that the theory of evolution is the explanation for the observations. Evolution does not explain itself. The theory of evolution explains things from the single genetic code for all living organisms, to the observed nested hierarchy, to the progression of life apparent in the fossil record, to why organisms seem designed for their environment. I'll say it again, because it's important and might clear up some of your profound confusion. The theory of evolution does not explain itself. The observations of living organisms lead to the theory of evolution. The theory of evolution is not a goal of science but a conclusion.
