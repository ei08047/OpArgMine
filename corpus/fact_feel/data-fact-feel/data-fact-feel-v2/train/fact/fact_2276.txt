That logic can be applied to weeds or trees. Anything that is non-sentient, or non-mental existant. Should we make gardening illegal too? The thing is, you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us. Human beings are, by nature, sentient. That is what makes us different from wildlife. When that only difference is separated, then it should not share the same rights as you or me. An accurate analogy would be someone who's brain was ripped out and was kept on life support. It would only be a body, no person inside of it. Same goes with an embryo. It simply cannot override the rights of its host.
