Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.
