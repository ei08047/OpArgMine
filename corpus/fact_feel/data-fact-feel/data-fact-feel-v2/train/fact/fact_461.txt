Let's give credit where credit is due. Science taught that the world was the centre of the universe. The leading scientists convinced churchmen to take allegorical passages of the Bible and re-interpret them as literal. The ancient Greeks, who were esteemed in Europe as the pre-eminent scientists of their day believed this.
They also believed that people were made up of four elements. And taught this.
Scientists backed up racism
"No rational man (writes Thomas Huxley, a contemporary evolutionist), cognizant of the facts, believes that the average Negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man. And if this be true, it is simply incredible that, when all his disabilities are removed, and our prognathous relative has a fair field and no favor, as well as no oppressor, he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival, in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites." (Thomas H. Huxley, "Lay Sermans, Addresses and Reviews" (New York: Appleton, 1871) p. 20. Huxley was arguing that blacks could not compete intellectually with Caucasians, even under equal and fair conditions.)"
