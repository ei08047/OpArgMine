”Not aware”???????
Not aware of what?
Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch. They are aware of loud noises.
Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry. They are aware of their own movement.
Pinch them, they will cry.
They are self aware as they chew on their toes.
And of course puppies are aware as well.
Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware.
