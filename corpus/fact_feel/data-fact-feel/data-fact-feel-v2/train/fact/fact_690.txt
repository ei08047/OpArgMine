You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. 
Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.
Do a find on, "Hence it must be assumed" to see the quote in context.
Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read "Origin" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is "artificial selection." Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man "...intentionally or by chance picked out..." characteristics. Of course, by use of the word "chance", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.
