You have to be logical and realistic in your expectations of what can demonstrated/observed as evolution in action and what can only be described from evidence from the distant past.
We can see the evolution of organisms in the world today, but because of the reproductive timeframe of many creatures we would not expect to see signifcant evolution take place in their populations over the last couple of hundred years. Take something that reproduces fast enough and great changes can be seen- look at the HIV virus and the myriad separate strains that have developed from a common ancestor in just a few decades of observation.
Ancient life can never be observed in its living state- all we have are the remains of these creatures in the form of fossils. As we can position these remains in time using stratigraphy and radiometric dating we can see what their relative temporal positions were. By comparing similar forms we can see how a descendant differs from its ancestor so we can determine how the structure of that line changed with time. So we see what has changed and when but we cannot see the exact "how", in the ancient instance at least (this is where the study of the modern gives insight).
