We often have debates in our Sixth Form (College), but I have also attended several "debate camps" - each a weekend long. I also attended a day at oxford which was made up of a few formal debates and just a bit of teaching on Philosophy and Classics. Apart from that - I have been on debate forums for quite some time, and I've gained experience from there too.
