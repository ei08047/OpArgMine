But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the "right to abortion" ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied. It's not the Court's function to legislate from the bench. It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected.
