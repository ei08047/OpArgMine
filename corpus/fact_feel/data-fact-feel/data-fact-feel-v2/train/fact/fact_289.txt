And wrong again. Hypotheses become theories once "enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedl" as you crudely phrase it. Laws deal with tiny parts of the theory that can be expressed in simple mathematical terms. Natural selection is in it's basic form a law. But there is masses more to it than a simple law, so it gets to be a theory. Theories are the pinacle of achievement in science: they are, in simple laymen's terms, fact.
