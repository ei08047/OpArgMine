You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. 
You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance.
