THE STATE v. BUZZARD.
Buzzard decided 2:1 to uphold a law restricting concealed carry. But had the question been is there an individual right o keep and bear arms for one's own protection, the court would have split 2:1 in favor of that right. So your mention of that case makes little sense if you are trying to make the point that Heller was not true to precedent. Heller was not about concealed carry, but rather the RKBA for self defense
Of the 3 judges, only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller. Dickensen read the RKBA as a limited individual right to keep and bear arms for the protection of the state (a right which does not encompass self defense).
