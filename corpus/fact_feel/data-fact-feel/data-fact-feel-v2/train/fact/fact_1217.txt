Actually it has been prosecuted under 42 UDC 1981 and 1986. It dates back to the first Civil Rights ruling in , oh, about 1866 but I would have to check the date to be certain. That is one reason Thomas and Stevens felt it was incorporated under the P or I clause.
What is your point about the rifle comment? Did it just sound cool so you threw that out there for the cats? :)
