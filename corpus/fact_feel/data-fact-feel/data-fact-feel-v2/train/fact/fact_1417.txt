The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and the son of God subject to a shameful death (Wisdom of Solomon “Let us condemn him with a shameful death”). Paul refers to the “archons”, the evil heavenly rulers of the age, as those who crucified Jesus (1 Cor 2:8) and extols the justice of the Romans (Ro. 13:1-3). The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection (Kloppenborg). No earthly Jesus, no crucifixion, no death. It is all myth, man.
