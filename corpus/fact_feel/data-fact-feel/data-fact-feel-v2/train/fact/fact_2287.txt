Although few mothers would do such a thing, I think that it is clear a mother would have the same right to do this as with a world-famous violinist. The fact that we would disapprove of such a women is not really important: emotive reactions don't constitute proof. If they did, the writer could simply say: 'I think women who have abortions are terrible' and his job would be done.
I'm dubious about the whole human rights basis of much modern debate on issues like abortion - I support neither the premises, reasoning or conclusion of the violinist argument. But this whole counter-argument seems to me extremely weak.
