We don't ignore it. We look at the circumstances-all these stories are from civilizations/groups that live on or near flood plains. Floods are common place. Catastrophic floods, not so much.
You, however, must ignore things. 
For example; where is the global layer of sediments which the flood would have had to have laid down? Such a sediment layer would be quite thick, and uniformly found around the globe, and would consist of particles sorted by density. We would expect to find no signs of life within this layer (no tracks or burrows, and no signs of growing plant life such as paleosols are tree roots). This sedimentary layer would show signs of being layed down in water. As well, any animal fossils (plant too), would be indiscrimately mixed. We would expect, for example, to find trilobites alongside modern day rays, rabbits with velociraptors, etc.
Now, can you point out where such a global layer exists Archie? If it doesn't, that pretty much debunks the flood "theory". But you just ignore that don't you?
