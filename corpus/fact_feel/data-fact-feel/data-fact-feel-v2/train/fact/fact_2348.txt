While that may be true for some - perhaps even many - I was just responding to the OP. That said, I think it foolish to claim/believe that the bible is all wrong. I consider myself an atheist, but I fully recognize - and expect - that much, perhaps even most of the events mentioned in the bible actually occurred. I do, however, also realize that the books of the bible were written at a much different time, that even real events were likely embellished, in some cases to the point of absurdity (knocking down walls with great shouts and the like...). Although I do not and will not pretend to be a biblical scholar or historian of any sort, it seems to me that the bible could be seen as a biased, mythology-laden chronicle of the history of a particular group of people. Interesting historically, but not very reliable as a guide to the true events of the time, and even less so for a guide to moral behavior and describing a Universe-creating Deity.
