But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.
To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.
It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.
