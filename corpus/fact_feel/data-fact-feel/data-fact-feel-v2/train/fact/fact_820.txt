This is obviously incorrect since Earth and Mars are were created only 6,000 years ago. And how did they know that Mars would be so close this year?
I have other questions too. How do they know that Pluto has a 249 year orbit of the sun since it wasn't discovered until 1930. No one has seen it orbit the sun yet. How did they know that it would actually come closer to the sun than Neptune in 1979 and move forther away again in 1999? They told me that when I was young. But no one had ever seen it. It was just speculation - a scientific theory, right??
