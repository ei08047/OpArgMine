I admit I didn't know who Sermonti was at first. A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco, one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante. a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980. He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose' to be part of science, giving such examples as: "In the presence of the inducer (lactose) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4)." In case you never took biochemistry, this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals.
