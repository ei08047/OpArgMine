According to history. I see you litterally ignored how it was wrong when one looks at how blacks were treated. How does it not? Blacks were paid less because they were black, Black soldiers weren't sent to fight because they were black. Black officers couldn't even command moderate level units. Black soldiers were treated as slaves when captured and often executed, not even afforded the rights of captured white northern soldiers. In fact it went so far as if a White officer in command of a black unit was captured, he was executed because he commanded a black unit. White officers captured from white units were treated as prisoners. White soldiers who didn't even speak english recruited off immigrantion ships from Europe were paid the normal amount. White soldiers were sent to fight, not sent to dig fortifications or ditches or latrines. Blacks were not treated equally in any way during the war, and reconstroction period in the north and the south shows a stark contrast in a belief of unequal creation. I suggest you go back and learn something about the war before talking about it.
