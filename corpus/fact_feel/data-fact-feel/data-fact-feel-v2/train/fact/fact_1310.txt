its still not a bilateral relation. all living thing manifest energy, but not all things that manifest energy are alive. its easy to turn on your car ignition and make the engine run, heat up, generate electricty and make noise, all from the chemical energy in the gasoline. Still the car isnt alive. on the other hand, in the living body, energy is constantly being converted from chemical to other forms, and the moment energy stops transferring, the body is dead. 
the relationship between life and energy exists, but it still doesnt conclude that life is energy
