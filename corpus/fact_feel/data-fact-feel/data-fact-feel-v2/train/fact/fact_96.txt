Well, that was a bait-and-switch but it wasn't very masterful. Actually, there are two color morphs in arctic foxes that are determined by a single locus. You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the "blue morph". The "white morph" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the "matter of months" that you state), and that isn't evolution. It is evolution that the arctic foxes, like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae, have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons.
