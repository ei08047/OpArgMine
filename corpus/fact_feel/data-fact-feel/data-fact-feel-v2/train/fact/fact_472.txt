You show a gap to be inexplicable via natural forces by trying to explain it via natural forces. You can't do it by hypothesising supernatural forces, because that's just meaningless unfalsifiable speculation. ID doesn't have a different method of searching - all it does is give up quicker. That's how it 'detected design' in the eye; that's how it 'detected design' in blood clotting, the immune system - it just gave up looking for natural explanations and assumed design filled the gap.
