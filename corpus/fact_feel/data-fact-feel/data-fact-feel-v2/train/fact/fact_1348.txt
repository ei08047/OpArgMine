Although I'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils (the term is misleading) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating. I'd be interested to see the paper if anyone has a PDF. It would seem to suggest that the origins of this particular molecule go back to the Ordovician at least, prior to the reptile/mammal split. Anyway, thought people might be interested :)
