Oh, I suspect my kid likes girls well enough, but most of them aren't any good at football so he finds them relatively useless (unless they are good at video games).
Lots of kids were losing it early when i was young, too. I remember it being peer pressure thing, an attampt to be cool. And I also remember sex ed being pretty sad....
