Right. That is the white morph in winter fur. Here it is in summer fur. And here is the blue morph in summer fur and winter fur. The fact is that some arctic foxes never are pure white. And it doesn't take a matter of months for them to change from dark to light. I spent a year where I saw lots of these animals every day. Remind me to tell you about Archie, who lived under the C Battery mess hall.
But that's not really the point. Your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution. The ability of the foxes to change may be evolution but the fact that they do change every year and then back again isn't.
