Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.
