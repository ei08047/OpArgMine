There's a difference between these tests.
Accipitridae, (and you by implication that you've not picked it up and called him to task) are mixing up the ancestory of individuals - giving a list of every single member of a family, to that of a species by species account. The difference is both of scale, and testability; written records aren't as long lasting as biological ones. You should be able to use science for whole species ancestory; after-all scientists can tell us with confidence that chimps are near relations, gorillas relations a bit further removed etc. 
Or, should we question those that tell us chimps are near relations?
