no they are not. you quote a web site that is not dawkin's interpretations of biomorphs and suggest that the web site's interpretation is what dawkins created biomorphs for. 
it is outlines very clearly in "the blind watchmaker" as to what limitations should be put on the biomorphs when comparing them to real life. 
again i say to reclaim integrity admit that dawkins never suggested that biomorphs should be considered as a model for evolution or natural selection, and there was only one main point to be taken from them (small mutations are more likely to produce benefits than large mutations).
