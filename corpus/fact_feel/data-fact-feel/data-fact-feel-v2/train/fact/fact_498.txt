Oh come on Steeeeve, around 50% of fertilized embroyo's will fail to implant anyway, so nature 'has killed/'is killing' half of all the people who have ever existed anyway. You cannot tell me that none of those are not just fluke losses of otherwise perfectly healthly embryos.
Also, prevention of implantation is only one of several mechanisms by which emergency contraception works- it also prevents ovulation, disrupts passage of a released egg and inhibits fertilzation occuring in the first place.
