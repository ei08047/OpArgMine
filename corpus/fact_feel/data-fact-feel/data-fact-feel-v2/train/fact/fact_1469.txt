And I have never seen a non-living process chase a rabbit either. But that does not imply by any logic which I have ever encountered that rabbit chasing is a key characteristic of all living organisms. Perhaps in your world some means all but not in mine. The question is not whether SOME living systems exhibit volition, some do. The question is whether ALL living systems exhibit volition - many do not. Those that do not could not have evolved at all if evolution requires volition.
