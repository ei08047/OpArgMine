Why do you apply the term evolution to these? Do you, deep-down, believe that these have resulted from evolution too? You are not alone in making evolution an absolute all-encompassing world-view... Oddly enough Close_slave_can denies that anyone does this.
"Evolution is not alone in its naturalism. All science, all engineering, all manufacturing, and most other human endeavours are equally naturalistic. If we must discard evolution because of this philosophy, then we must also discard navigation, meteorology, farming, architecture, printing, law, and virtually all other subjects for the same reason."

However, the influence is not all one-way..
"We live under capitalism, so we have capitalist science. We want to bring a different set of values into being, to bring about a new set of ruling ideas—ideas of a society without rulers, a part of a different ideology or world-view. We want to bring about a socialist society. It will, if we are vigilant, have a socialist science. I can imagine it, or some of it."

"The major political task is seen as showing the reality of capitalist domination in the apparently neutral science"

In capitalist societies, the influence of money-ideology helps shape evolution in a dialectic relationship.
"In short, the triumph of Darwinism implied the death of God and set the stage for replacing Biblical religion with a new faith based on evolutionary naturalism. That new faith would become the basis not just of science but also of government, law and morality. It would be the established religious philosophy of modernity." (Fr. Seraphim Rose, “Genesis, Creation and Early Man”, p17)
