Your lungs depend on partial pressure to oxygenate your blood. A change in percentage concentration will result in a change in partial pressure. This affects how we breathe. Projections show that with global warming there will be a vast increase in ocean cloud coverage, resulting in inhibited growth and photosynthesis of ocean plants, resulting in a lower yield of O2 on average.
