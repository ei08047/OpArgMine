If a square is opposite to a circle (and it isn't, by the way), then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites (by your own argument), in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite' states. It's an argument I raised before, you said they weren't opposites, now you cite non-opposites! Why do you keep refuting previous arguments they YOU have made?
