I think i disagree with the majority of people that have already posted here. evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive, and the both cannot be true at the same time, since there can be only one true way that life originated (even though i know that "evolution" is not the correct term to describe the origin of life, and die-hard evolutionist might chew me out for using it wrongly. I prefer to use the term "spontaneous origin" rather than "evolution"). since creationism and the collection of spontaneous origin theories are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist, then upon proving either you automatically disprove the other. and if a 3rd unforseen theory is proven as the real way life originated on earth, then it would automatically disprove the both creationism and the current spontaneous origin theories
the 2 concepts are pretty much diametrically opposed right now, both competing for evidence to support its case, and a strengthening of one theory automatically implies a weakening of the other
