Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.
