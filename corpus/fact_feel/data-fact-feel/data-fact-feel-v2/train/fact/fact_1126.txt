Well, I just don't see this. It's an observable fact that species produce far more progeny than can possibly hope to survive. Consequently, the grim reaper will take most of them before they can breed -- which is NS in action. There is absolutely nothing implausible about variation being random, with only those variants that are compatible with environmental conditions having a chance of success. The rest you just wouldn't see.
