The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false. The NG is a standing army. The militia is not. The NG can be federalized. The militia can not. They wear the same uniforms. The officers all know each other and play golf together.
If the NG is the militia, then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools, hospitals, libraries, and churches. No federalization of NG. Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence, communication, and socializatlion, right down to even different uniforms.
