Just a layperson of course. But I'll give it a stab.
... For besides the point that vitalism is an untestable hypothesis and thus useless in looking at these questions... 
How does such reasoning prove anything of the sort. All you have is the fact that humans understand the reasons for some variations and not for others. Besides, a selected variation does not mean that it will bode for the best. That is WW's interpretation and value judgment ... in hindsight ... a variation of the view .. twas God's will, He knew what he was doing ... but all you have definitively established is that you yourself looked to the past and infered intent as to the future based on your selective perceptions about what was going on and what feels good. Time and space are muddled. Seems to me that the observer using the more effective scientific method sticks (well) religiously to the present moment.
Plus, "acausal" doesn’t really mean "no cause," does it? Just that we haven’t determined one. It looks to me like the agnostic view. We don't know what's going on.
Random also seems to mean that there are unknown variables or conditions present.
Reminds me of discussion re abiogenesis and the term "spontaneous." I think us laypeople at least mistakenly look at causation in a very linear fashion. Rather than in terms of a set of conditions giving rise to other phenomenon.
An aside. I don’t like the “mistake” view (DNA replication). Back to direction, if there's a wrong turn.
