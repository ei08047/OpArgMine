Well, if I'm allowed to go purely on what I see, I've never seen an illegally owned firearm in the UK, and handguns are (for all intents and purposes) banned here. This should be a knock-down argument, should it not?
If you don't want to go on what you read or hear, why are you debating the issue online?
