That's because it's not a falsifiable hypothesis. No matter what happens to an organism, you will always be able to say it happened on purpose.
The observations you cherry-pick are those you use when attempting to prove that darwinian evolution cannot work. So you ignore the countless studies where variation is unambiguously stochastic and focus on the very small number which seemed initially to show non-random mutation. You ignore the countless studies where adaptive mutations arise, and can be elevated by carcinogens, in the absence of any hypermutational organismic response, and focus only on those where it does occur.
