A lot of people say that Jesus is the son of God. Others say that Jesus was actually God Himself, who came to Earth. Whichever way is the real case, Jesus didn't need to carry anything, because God had the ability to wipe two cities off the face of the map by raining down fire and brimstone.
God has plenty of firepower at His disposal. And He never said "lay down and die because it's wrong to protect yourselves from harm."
