There is the ever popular "smartest state" report that places kansas at #15 in the nation. It can be found at http://www.morganquitno.com/edrank.htm
A lot of kansas educators take exception to that report because it factors in things that may not be related. For example, Kansas kids score in the top 5 states in ALL testing categories, BUT, we score 38th in spending per pupil. We score poorly in teacher salaries (28), and do not have teachers on our school boards (conflict of interest). All those factors count against us, as well as several others. Then you have new jersey and vermont, where the kids apparently can't take a test, and where their average SAT scores may be confused with a shoe size, and they score in the top 5 because they spend a LOT more than kansas. A lot of people argue that they penalize states for efficiency in their education system. 
If you want the most comprehensive report out there, go to www.alec.org and request a copy of their "report card for education". I think it is free, and it breaks down the states by several categories. It is what I always used to figure out how good a job our system was doing.
