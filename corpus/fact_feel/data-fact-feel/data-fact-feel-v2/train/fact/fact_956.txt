And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a "high powered rifle" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?
And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!
Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics.
