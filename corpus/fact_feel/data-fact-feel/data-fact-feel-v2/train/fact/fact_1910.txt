Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.
Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism.
