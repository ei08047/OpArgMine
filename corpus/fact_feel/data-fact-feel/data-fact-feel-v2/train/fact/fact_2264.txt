First off, not all pro-choice advocates support this position. Second, How does a sonogram help to make an informed choice? What does a sonogram actually inform a pregnant woman about...that she is pregnant? I would think that if she was going to get a sonogram, that she would know that she is already pregnant. Seems like simple logic to me. 
By saying it would help them make a better choice, don't you really mean to say that it might influence them to not have an abortion, which is actually your choice for them? You seem to be counting on the puppy store effect. You can drive by the puppy store every day without giving a thought to buying a puppy. But if you actually stop and look at one, you might just feel sorry for the pathetic little puppy couped up in the little cage, and decide to buy it just to "rescue" it from it's plight. It goes something like this:
"awww...look at the cute little puppy, we can't leave it here, we just have to take it home". 
4 months later, that same cute little puppy is sitting in an SPCA shelter waiting to either be adopted or destroyed. All because it's do-gooder owner made the decision to buy it based on emotion rather than informed choice.
