So-called "Partial Birth" Abortions are so rare as to be negligible. This ban was just a small step onto taking away a woman's right to choice.
If it were a "born baby" then they wouldn't have to perform the abortion. It would be able to survive in a respirator.
There you go again misusing a legal term.
You are the sick one for using emotional arguements and ignoring the facts.
