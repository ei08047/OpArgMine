It's true, I find the story on sites that are generally anti-bush. However, this was a radio show transcript, not a site. 
Larry Flint says "'I've talked to the woman's friends,' Flynt said. 'I've tracked down the doctor who did the abortion, I tracked down the Bush people who arranged for the abortion,' Flynt said. 'I got the story nailed." I haven't seen it either confirmed or denied by anyone more reputable.
