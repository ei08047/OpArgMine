Correct. The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension' of the Federal Army (and Air Force). We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well.
You may recall that back in the 60's Gov. George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization' of National Guard troops which were used against him, by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools. Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation, the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard' units henceforth.
The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia' is laughable and wholly inaccurate. It's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding'.
