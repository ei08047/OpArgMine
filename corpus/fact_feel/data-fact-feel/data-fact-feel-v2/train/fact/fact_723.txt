Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality. I believe that you are right about Japanese culture, if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates, but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality.
