So increased levels of testosterone cause agressiveness in women? Androgen causes aggressive behavior in females?
You know this crud is ridiculous and long refuted. Wanna go around again like Bellesiles, who by the way is now admitting it was a wrong, fake story and lays the blame on the student who told him the story. If he can't get reality right in current events, just how accurate do you think he is in history? Yuk, yuk, yuk. Just a portent of how skewed his upcoming book will be with all his bias and semi-literate "facts". I will keep my money in my pocket and fold it to double it :)
Why do you always play water and seek the lowest levels?
