We can't pick both? Why the hell not? Phenotypic plasticity is not an unknown phenomenon or fringe belief. You are presenting a false dichotomy. Plasticity arose via "Darwinian" evolution, not instead of it.
To clarify: we do not claim that life evolved via Lamarckian mechanisms, but we don't deny that plasticity is real. What we reject is that that plasticity is the driving force of change.
