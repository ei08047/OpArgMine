Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment. It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature. This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another. Given a complete understanding of molecular biology, we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch.
