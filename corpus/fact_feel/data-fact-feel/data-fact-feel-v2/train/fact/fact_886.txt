Sure,,,,I have more than a few that was purchased from a individual,,,,no registration,license,no paperwork.I hand him the money and he hands me the gun.All legal and absolutley no paper trail.
As far as guns purchased from a licensed dealer,all that is documented is the info for a background check,And by law that info must be destroyed within,I think 90 days.
Kind of puts a snag in the whole confiscation idea ,,ehhhh?
