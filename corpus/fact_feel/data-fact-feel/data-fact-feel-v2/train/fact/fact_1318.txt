I think pro-gun extremists' stubborn and uncompromising opposition to even small amounts of gun control appears unreasonable to a lot of people and turns people against them. The pro-gun side plays a role in creating their own enemies. One example of this happening is the case of Sarah Brady. In her own words:
"Dorothy and the manager of the company stopped by in their pickup truck with the idea that [we] would go swimming. Scott got in first, and I climbed in behind him. He picked up off the seat what looked like a toy gun and started waving it around. I took [it] from him, intending to say he must never point even a toy gun at anyone. As soon as I got it into my hand, I realized it was no toy. It was a fully loaded little Saturday night special, very much like the one that had shot Jim.
"I cannot even begin to describe the rage that went through me. To think that my precious little boy, 6 years old, had actually held a loaded .22 pushed me right over the edge. I handed the gun to Dorothy. I didn't want to see it again, I saidâ€”get rid of it. The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have it for self-protection against union members. I didn't reply.
"Days later Sarah heard a report that the National Rifle Association was pushing a bill known as McClure-Volkmer, which called for the repeal of a Federal gun-control law passed in 1968.
"Instantly, all the fury that had hit me in the pickup truck came rushing back. I knew the 1968 law well. It was a sensible measure that essentially set age limits for gun buyers, imposed some I inspection and bookkeeping requirements on gun dealers and banned the import of Saturday night specials. I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association's Washington headquarters. I said, 'My name is Sarah Brady, and you've never heard of me, but I am going to make it my life's ambition to try to put you out of business.' "
