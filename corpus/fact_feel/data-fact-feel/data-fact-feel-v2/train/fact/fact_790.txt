Of course it is based on the evidence, as is creation. They are both different interpretations about the same evidence that are ultimately determined by a person's underlying assumptions or belief systems. But we can reason that there must be God by way of observing the beauty and design all around us, the truth of the Bible, etc. All of these things only imply that a creator exists. We see a computer program, we know it needs a programmer. In a similar way, we see the highly complex DNA system, we must reason, coming to a similar conclusion that it needs a Designer.
