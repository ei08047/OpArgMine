Let's make sure we're talking about the same thing here Art. You don't find this reprehensible? FROM THE OP:
According to Williams and the Florida Department of Health, she went into labor and delivered a live baby girl.
What Williams and the Health Department say happened next has shocked people on both sides of the abortion debate: One of the clinic's owners, who has no medical license, cut the infant's umbilical cord. Williams says the woman placed the baby in a plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.
You don't see placing a live new born baby in a bio hazard bag and throwing it into a trash receptacle as medical staff stood by and watched as shocking and disgraceful? Not to mention murder? Is that what you're telling me?
