You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools. Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that "theory". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis. 
Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out.
