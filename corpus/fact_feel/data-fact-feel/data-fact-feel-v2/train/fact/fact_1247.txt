Kelvin's already proposed that the armed population of America has given serious protection to the US, specifically he mentioned Japan deciding not to invade.
This is of course a nonsense. Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated'. Did it stop the US?
Secondly, the specific example given; that of Japan, is a nonsense. These same people who flung themselves in flying bombs, who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender, he believes were worried about a few grannies carrying sawn-off shot-guns.
