Yes, exactly, lions/sea otters/seals/manatees/whales. Note that these creatures do not fit in a continuum of animals.
The rest of the post seems irrelevant to the question of this "continuum" prediction. If I am wrong, then you may clarify this. Otherwise, I see no reason to complicate this line of argument with side issues.
