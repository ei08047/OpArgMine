First, you wouldn't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane. It's stupid and useless, but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down, that's for sure. The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is. I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns, since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it (like you can't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you can't yell fire in a crowd.) Isn't this what most "living document" people say? Oh, I get it now? It's not about that is it? The fact of the matter is, you are dissatisfied that the line wasn't drawn to limit even more of it, i.e. a complete ban on firearms, only the national guard or armed forces should have them. Sorry, but if you were to do that, it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more. The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn, but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm.
