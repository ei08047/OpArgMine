I linked to a post that sufficiently validates my point. If you want to discuss in more detail the broader implications of current abortion policy, I would be happy to do so.
We can start with your suggestion that abortions are illegal after the first trimester. That suggestion, while common, is not correct. 12% of abortions in the United States occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. That's an estimated total of about 154,800 abortions in 2002.
And besides that, you miss the point. The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for (in some instances) the third trimester. Thus, they would defend a woman's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other.
It also would be interesting to know (since you felt the need to weight in) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection?
