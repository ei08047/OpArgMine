Perhaps an analogy. Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink (personally against it, for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose. So, you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are "pro-choice" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves).
Pro-life would be: You don't drink and smoke (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either.
