Yes, brains in a vat, the Matrix, and Last Thursdayism are unprovable. That is why science has been so successful - it only deals with naturalistic explanations for naturalistic phenomena. An unconstrained supernatural force can provide an answer for anything (fossils in the ground, complexity in organisms, etc.) but will provide an explanation for nothing. Science is in the business of providing explanations - philosophy is down the hall and on your left.
