I believe you can relinquish the child support responsibility if you also relinquish parental rights.
Complicated stuff - kind of going through it right now as we are working on revoking my son's bilogocal father's parental rights. Once that is done I can not pursue him for support.
Plus, plenty of dads do it the easy way, don't pay, don't care and disappear.
