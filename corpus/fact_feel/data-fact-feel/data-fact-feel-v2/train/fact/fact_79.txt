Could be phrased in a more polite way. Probably the whole name of this forum should be changed from creation versus evolution to creationism versus alternatives. Because every creationist I have seen on this board has used the creationist definition of evolution which non-creationists flatly reject and it wastes time. The replys to this very thread show that many people know the correct defintion of biological evolution and do not tolerate any other definition. If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the "evolution of the universe" because it will just waste time.
