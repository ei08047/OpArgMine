Actually, you could probably make your point better if you referred to a "theistic evolutionist" who rejected all creation stories (and other history) in the bible.
As for your point itself, it is fairly correct (in my opinion). Theistic evolution makes no assertions that contradict either evolutionary theory or the teachings of the bible (morals, etc.). This presents no problems for atheistic evolutionists.
