Nice spin by way of projection but you are wrong as usual. I find your defination of your position to be too funny. Like it is some how wrong to turn the tables on the left by using their methods. You still fail to address the fact of liberal firearm owners. Or is the fact of owning a firearm enough to have one drummed out of the liberal camp, buttons ripped off and sword broken? emoticonXBye
