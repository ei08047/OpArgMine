Yet again, ignoring the point of the article. Are you not familiar with the Grants' work?
This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years.
Here's the situation. Essentially, there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major. One is a small seed - easily cracked. The other is a large hard shelled seed. At one time, during a drought, the Grants observed that some native finches, Geospiza fortis, evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger, hard shelled seeds. In other words, the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end. The article (and I presume the paper published by the Grants) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch, G. magnirostris, with a correspondingly larger bill. The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size, having similar beak size. As a result, they directly competed for scarce resources. As a result, large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage. As a result, the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller, more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up, while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger, hard shelled seeds.
Anyone interested should read Weiner, Jonathan. The Beak Of The Finch. 1994. Vantage Books, New York. It won a Pulitzer Prize and is the story of the Grants' research on Daphne Major.
