Private property rights are the most fundamental of all rights and the basis for any government at all. When a society ignores those basic rights it ceases to be civilized and diminishes to tyranny, anarchy and crime. Previous societies have always used criminals to encroach on property rights and deprive the people of fundamental rights of any kind. When people cease to have dominion and exercise rights to protect that property by any means possible there is tyranny. There is no rule of law in the UK any more.
BRITAIN is there! Proud to have broken those ties back in 1776 :) emoticonXBye
