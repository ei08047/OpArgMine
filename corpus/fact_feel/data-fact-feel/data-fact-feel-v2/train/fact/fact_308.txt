Right. We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example.
