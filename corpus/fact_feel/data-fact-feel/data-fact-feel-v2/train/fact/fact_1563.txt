No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that "life is irreducibly complex" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like "pieces that happen to be fitted together". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!
