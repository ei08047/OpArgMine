Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.
