Another personal favorite of mine... When I showed up to a seminar hosted by a local creationist, I challenged him to produce a textbook with false evidence. He couldn't. When I brought every last biology and biochemistry textbook from my college career to him for him to scour, he didn't even bother to look.
Translation: this claim is XXXX, and Wells knows it.
