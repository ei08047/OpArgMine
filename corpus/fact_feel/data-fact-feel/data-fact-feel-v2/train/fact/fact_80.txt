Your obvious ignorance of medical procedure is astonishing. I do not think any such uninformed person has a right to an opinion, but since you have decided you do, let me try to inform you. A doctor would never "stick a pair of scissors" into a baby's head. Any propaganda that has told you otherwise is just that, propaganda. If the doctor is "holding in his hands" a baby about to be born, (which implies labor) and that child weighs more than 500 grams (just under two pounds), he is required by law to do all in his power to protect and support that child's life. Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother's life is at stake, no, it does not always "save the mother's life" in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary. Example- the mother has advanced liver disease, when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child, but as her pregnancy advanced, so did her disease, so that now she is in complete renal failure. The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy, she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy. He urges her to abort the child, in order to save her life. This is one case where a partial-birth abortion would be the method.
If the woman decides to continue her pregnancy, she might die, the child might die as well. But if she chooses not to have the child, she lives to fight another day. 
Tough choices- What right on earth would I have to enter into this situation and tell her that "god says you gotta put your life at risk and carry this child, even though both of you might die"????
I may be sick, but I pride myself on the ability to create an informed opinion on a matter, and until I am informed, I keep my opinions to myself.
That should be in the bible somewhere
