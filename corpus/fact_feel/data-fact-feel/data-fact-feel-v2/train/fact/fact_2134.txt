So many errors, where does one begin? The entire specious claim that there are pygostylian Avialae which pre-date Archaeopteryx lithographica stems from Chatterjee's most dubious fossil, "Protoavis texensis," and Confuciusornis sanctus, which was initially described as dating from Tithonian horizons of the terminal Jurassic--although subsequently Hou et al (1996) presented more conclusive evidence placing the confuciusornid material from the Barremian (much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia, who made much of Confuciusornis being from the Jurassic). As for "Protoavis," the holotype and paratype are almost certainly composed of material which is not conspecific, and the material seems to correspond to a coelophysoid/drepanosaur chimera (Paul 2002), or a coelophysoid chimera (Gauthier & Rowe 1990). 
As for the Eichstatt Conference. It hardly concluded that Archaeotperyx was a "true bird," it concluded that as opposed to the hypotheses of some (e.g., Thulborn 1976), Archaeopteryx was indeed the most basal avialian, and not a less derived member of Coelurosauria. One would actually suggest referring to the published data from the conference, in Hecht et al 1985, before continuing to make such assertions.
