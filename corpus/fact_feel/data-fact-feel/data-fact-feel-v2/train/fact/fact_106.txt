Well, the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith.
If you say "I know there is no god," this statement requires faith.
You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god. 
The presence of religion has nothing to do with this faith and it's not a religion, just a gross assumption with no "proof."
