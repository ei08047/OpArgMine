I guess I should ask why you think the "less evolved" chimpanzee should have gone exinct?
What happened is that common ancestor to chimpanzees. for some reason, was divided into at least two populations which did not come into contact with each other much. One population evolved into the modern chimpanzee (a forest animal), and the other into modern humans (a savannah animal).
