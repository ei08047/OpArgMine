Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried. Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently, and all we are talking about is giving them that choice. Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them.
Though now that I think about it, you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples? Well, in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status. The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. I see no reason why this wouldn't be updated along with marriage.
As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners, well again, that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes, not against same-sex marriage specifically. It isn't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples.
