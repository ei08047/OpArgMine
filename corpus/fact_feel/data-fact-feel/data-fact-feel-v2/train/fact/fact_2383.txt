Well, I'm not sure the principles of physics and such would be any different - surely God could make them the way they are now and suspend them at will.
That said, it seems reasonable, from a biological/geological perspective, that the following observations would be made:
1. There would be a single mass extinction event for ALL flora and fauna, not numerous, asynchronous extinctions in differing environments encompassing particular groups of creatures
2. This mass extinction would coincide with a single, large, relatively uniform stratum of a more or less heterogeneous composition, or perhaps a very few strata still with the same basic property, not numerous discontinuous strata
3. there would be numerous complete fossils of all creatures living at the time, to include soft-bodied creatures (since rapid burial followed by fossilization is much more likely to preserve soft tissues either via imprints or actual fossilization)
4. the complete fossils should all be found in contemporaneous strata, i.e., human fossils should be found in the same layers as dinosaurs
5. The biological species concept should be very simple to define, as all living (and extinct) creatures would be, first of all, much less diverse, and each 'kind' would be simple to classify
6. there would be no reason to find, or even to expect to find, a unity of basic forms or functions or genomic content in extant creatures (e.g., no 'universal' genetic code, mammals with more or less than 4 limbs, etc.)
Well, that is a few off the top of my head...
