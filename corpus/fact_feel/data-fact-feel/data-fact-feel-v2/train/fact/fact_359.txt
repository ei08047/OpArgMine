No, it doesn't. The big picture of evolution is that it is the observed change in the heritable characteristics in populations of organims over generations. In cases where populations become fragmented, the separate (reproductively isolated) segments of the population will accumulate genetic differences. The longer they are separated, the more likely it will be that they will be unable to interbreed if united. This is observed. The result is the establishment of separate species.
