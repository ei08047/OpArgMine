I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago. 
Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution.
