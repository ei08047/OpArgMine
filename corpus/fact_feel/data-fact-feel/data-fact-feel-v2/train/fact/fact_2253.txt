So Bloomberg is suggesting that the ATF should seek to prosecute anyone and everyone, evidence or not.
This isn't how law enforcement works. This isn't how the Constitution works. You can't be prosecuted for a crime that you didn't commit, and for which there is no evidence to link you to it. But that's not good enough for Bloomberg, oh no. Bloomberg wants to ATF to view anyone attending a gun show as absolutely guilty, and subject to arrest, detainment and prosecution without evidence or witnesses, thus violating a person's Sixth Amendment rights.
And as I said before. Bloomberg makes absolutely no recommendation for what to do with these 35, supposedly, criminals sellers. He didn't want them charged with felonies, he didn't file civil suits against them, he didn't do anything. He just got the "evidence" he wanted and then he let them go scot free as if they'd done nothing. Obviously New York City style catch and release justice at its absolute finest.
Also note how the report refers to the SKS as "assault rifles". There's not a single feature on the SKS that would qualify it as either as "assault rifle" or an "assault weapon".
