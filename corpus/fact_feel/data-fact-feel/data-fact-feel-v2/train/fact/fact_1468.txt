Only those parts of the world that are ignorant and do not bother to do their research. Those who DO research recognize that even with the changes, there was still no ID being taught in our classrooms, and we still had stricter definitions of "science" and stricter curriculum than 38 other states.
Personally, I don't CARE which way they go with this. They just need to pick one and stick with it. The changes DO NO effect curriculum at the classroom level, and DO NOT allow for any alternate theories (if you want to call "god dunnit" a theory) to be taught. The whole thing has just been an expensive peeing contest between 2 sets of XXXXXX that has drawn the attention of a bunch of other XXXXXX who fail to recognize that it means NOTHING. It is essentially a philosophical argument without meaning or merit. 
Kansas has some of the best schools in the nations. We are in the top 5. This IDIOCY never should have been allowed to pollute our educational system, and it CERTAINLY should not have been re-introduced 4 times. The stupidity is simply mind boggling.
