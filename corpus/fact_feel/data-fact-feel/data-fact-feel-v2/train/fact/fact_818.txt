I see no evidence of a straw purchase having actually taking place. The video is so grainy and jumpy you can barely make out anything. And there's no camera evidence from the female investigator who was supposedly filling out the paperwork. And there are so many jumps in footage it almost looks like the film was cut multiple times to tell a brand new story.
Although I did notice at the beginning the introduction stated that it's illegal for someone to fill out the paperwork for you, and that it's a federal felony. So once again I must ask, if they have this evidence on tape, why were no arrests made? Supposedly these are licensed investigators, fully authorized and everything. Why did they choose to let a blatant offense go unpunished? By law and duty they were obligated to make arrests on the scene.
