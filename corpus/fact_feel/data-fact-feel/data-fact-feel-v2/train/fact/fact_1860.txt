To date, not a single profetallifer here has managed to come up with a way that, should, God forbid, the question of abortion be returned to the states, any state would enforce its ban on the procedure.
If State "A" bans abortions under any and all circumstances (the Palin proposal), and State "B" has a very liberal abortion law, just how do the officials from State "A" prevent their pregnant citizens from merely traveling to State "B" to have the procedure?
Similarly, what are the sanctions State "A" would put in place to enforce its abortion ban, and upon whom would they be enforced - the woman? the doctor?
So far, all we have heard is plaitudinous bloviation about the moral issue.emoticonXAngry
Let's get up close and personal. How will it work in the real world?
