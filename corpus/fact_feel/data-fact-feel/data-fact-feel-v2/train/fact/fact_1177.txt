Of course it shouldn't be used as birth control, but because of religious ignorance against birth control, in any form, so many don't have easy access, or even proper education about such things.
Places which have proper access and education have far fewer unwanted pregancies as well. The USA has twice as many unwanted pregancies as Canada and I think 36 times as many as Japan.
BTW, an interesting fact is that the USA (280 million} is now the 3rd most populous nation in the world right after China (1.3 billion), and India (1 billion). The former USSR had been 3rd, I think, with a little over 300 million.
