More propaganda! 
Analysys my thoin! its propagandist opinionary
"The news does reach the press -- including WorldNetDaily, which gives it a particularly... ah..... WorldnetDaily spin. (WND, out of California, still believes Ken Starr is part of the Vince Foster cover-up)."
^^^Ad Hominen? They hold a certain opinion on something completley unrelated to prove that WND does not know what its talking about....
Nothing to back this claim up, nor any attempt to show contradicting data. They mysteriously have data from a website from what I could tell was last updated in 1996 that does not even ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT USE OF GUNS IN CRIME!
Pitiful.
