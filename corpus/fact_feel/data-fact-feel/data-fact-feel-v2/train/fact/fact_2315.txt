I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic.
Well, ok it's "logical" but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions.
Just because something can't be detected doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
And, of course, if god is god the way we think about it, then God is everywhere, including in this universe. He is the universe (but we can't detect him). Does he exist now or not?
