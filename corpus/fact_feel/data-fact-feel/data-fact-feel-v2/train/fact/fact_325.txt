Not necessarily. It depends on a lot of conditions. If an organism falls in an anoxic environment, it may be fossilized. Sometimes they are buried quickly. Sometimes not. For example, the bottom of the Solnhofen lagoon about 140 to 170 million years ago was anoxic. Today, the bottom of the Black Sea is anoxic.
You don't explain why a bone has to be under pressure. I thought it was mineralization that made the fossil.
And so what? You seem to be claiming that there aren't any fossils. You can't be that dense, can you? What are those things that you find in museums of natural history?
