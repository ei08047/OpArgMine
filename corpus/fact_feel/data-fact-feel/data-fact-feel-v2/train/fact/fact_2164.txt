So despite his long article Behe is still working on the same assumption I stated above: function is only a product of conscious design: there is no other valid explaination of the structure and function of life.
Now, what I'd like to hear you describe is exactly how intelligent design works in action: 
1) How long does intelligent design take, x years or is it instantaneous?
2) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world?
3) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world?
4) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones, as evidenced by the fossil record?
5) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design?
I'm most interested to hear your ideas on these points.
