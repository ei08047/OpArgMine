What's wrong with that? Lots!
Rational thought alone keeps a person from doing just anything s/he wants. Should I, an atheist, kill another person’s children just to see if that person will then hate me? No, I shouldn’t. Doing so would be grossly immoral. I guess God couldn’t figure that one out for himself … poor Job … poor Job’s children.
There’s also the simple fact that we moral humans recognize the difference between being treated fairly and unfairly, and we even feel empathy, both of which even chimps seem to do at at least a rudimentary level. So do you argue that chimps must already believe in God?
It doesn't take religion to know of fairness or to be able to put oneself in another's shoes and consider how that person would feel based on our actions.
