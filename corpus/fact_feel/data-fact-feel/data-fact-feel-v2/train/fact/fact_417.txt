I know what you meant.
My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.
Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.
By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.
In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.
The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.
By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?
If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply "vote" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all.
