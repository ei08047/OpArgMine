Well, this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels. The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes.
Universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work. What does not work is our current system. Wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30% even wiyhout a reform bill. They spend 30% on administrative costs.
BTW, do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20%?
