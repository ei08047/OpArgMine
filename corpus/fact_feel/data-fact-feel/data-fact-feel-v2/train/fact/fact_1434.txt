In order for a round to be considered "armor piercing", it has to have a penetrator. As long as you are not using .223 with a penetrator, you have NO legal issues at a federal level. 
That particular round penetrated EVERY piece of body armor that we tested with the exception of the new stuff we were testing. The new stuff is a composite, a ceramic metal matrix shell over a honeycomb carbon composite. I weighed 85 lbs, so it is not something that you are going to see guys running around in (though I do have several sets that we constructed for the testing that I could sell for around $200,000.00 each). 
You MIGHT have feed problems (we did) with the round, in which case you need to take a dremel and smooth out your feed ramp. No big deal. Out of a makarov (short barrel) we were getting around 2850 FPS. Out of a bizon (15 inch barrel) we were at about 3000 FPS, well into rifle velocity land. 
The REAL benifit to a round like this (since I assume that most people are not simply looking to load cop killers) is that you have in inherently stable round, the .223, being fired at near rifle velocity, from a pistol. The round is stable to roughly 150 yards, then it begins to deteriorate. 3" groupings at 100 yards with our old POS test weapon were not uncommon. 1.5" with the bizon.
