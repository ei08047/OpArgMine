Yes. But that means that the cat "kind", a single pair, produced 4 genera with 36 species in, at most, a couple hundred years. And that doesn't even include domestic cats. It makes the head of any evolutionary biologist spin! Creationists who wish to deny evolution invoke hyperevolution for thousands of "kinds" to yield millions of species in hundreds of years. And yet, they deny evolution.
