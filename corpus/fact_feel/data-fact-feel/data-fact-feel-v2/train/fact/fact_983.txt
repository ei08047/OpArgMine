In that case it would be not registering your guns which would lead to confiscation rather than registering your guns. The logic of your argument seems questionable. It would be like arguing- "It's the outright truth that property taxes lead to confiscation because if you don't pay them the government can take your property." Would anybody seriously think that that is a good argument against property taxes?
