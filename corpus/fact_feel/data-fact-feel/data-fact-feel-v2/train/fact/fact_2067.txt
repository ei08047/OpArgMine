The NT was compiled in the late 4th Century AD, being criticised at the time for the overtly political choice of which texts were included as Canon and which were rejected to become the Apocrypha. Further it is now generally accepted that the text was altered at a later date to comply with OT prophesy. 
Like The Saxon Chronicles, King Arthur or Robin Hood there is too much romanticisation and mythologising to be certain of virtually anything in the text.
