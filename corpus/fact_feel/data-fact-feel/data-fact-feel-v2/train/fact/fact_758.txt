i like this. lets assume that both are mattes of faith, in that there is the unknown element in both cases (which there is). the only thing left is which fits reality best
the evidence that supports creation is a book written by some middle-east religiously biased men about 4000 years ago. nothing in this book can be replicated or observed, and they defy observable reality
the evidence that supprts the theory of evolution is the observed reality that dna mutates, species that adapt to their environment survive, fossils exist, several aging mechanisms date the planet in the billions of years, and life forms in the millions, and so on. 
so, do we believe our own eyes, or what a very very old dtory tells us we should believe. thats what it really comes down to, all other things being equal
