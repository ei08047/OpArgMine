You started off with criticizing gun banning, but now you seem to be criticizing tough punishments for criminals. A May 2006 article in the Cape Times said that "National law currently provides for a sentence of 25 years for illegal firearm possession."

So if the death penalty is the punishment for illegal gun possession then I suppose the law must have changed recently. I wonder if the people who claim that we don't need more gun laws but just tougher punishments for people who break current gun laws would support such a penalty.
