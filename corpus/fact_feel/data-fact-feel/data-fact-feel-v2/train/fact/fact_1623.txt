First, take a visit to Mount Olympus. Secondly, Greek myths were written for entertainment. Lastly, if Zeus or any other mythological gods existed, why wouldn't they/it preserve their worshippers? When a human (actually, in the case of the Jews, humanS) make efforts to completely eliminate a race or religious group of people and there Book (the Bible) for over thousands upon thousands of years, and the people and Book are still preserved, that is evidence of a God, in my opinion.
