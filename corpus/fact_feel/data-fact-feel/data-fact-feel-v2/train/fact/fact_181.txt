Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense, by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it. I don't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you're not at home, that's not good enough; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you're there.
Then there's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose. Responsible people already lock up their guns, they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers, they don't need a law to tell them to do what they're already doing. Such a proposal takes away responsibility, it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it.
There's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that isn't a crime or a threat to anyone's safety. Who should law enforcement be targeting more, a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia, or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store?
Police resources are limited as is. I don't see why we should be squandering what resources we have, going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone.
