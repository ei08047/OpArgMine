So, any creationist want to tell us why these people are so wrong?
Is the international committee a sign of a conspiracy?
Are they trying to hide the fact that radiometric dating techniques don't work?
Is there really a strong causal relationship between the environmental changes recorded in the rocks and the fossils found there?
Is there really "missing time" or was the 85 million years of the Ediacaran Period really contained in 100m of rock?
Is atmospheric oxygen a result of tectonic forces?
Well, what part of this article do creationist object to?
