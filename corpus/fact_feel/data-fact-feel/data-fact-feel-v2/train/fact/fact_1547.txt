Look again, Smith. All those killed in these places, died in a location where they were told they couldn't have a gun with them. More guns weren't a part of the equation, less guns were. There were no guns in these locations except for those illegally brought in by the killers, and those of the police who arrived after it was already too late.
Fewer guns aren't the answer, anybody with a dab of common sense would realize that because it's impossible to disarm the bad guys.
