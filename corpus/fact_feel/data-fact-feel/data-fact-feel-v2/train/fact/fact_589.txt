But thats not what unkerpaulie was getting at. Contraceptives deny the possibility of life, just at a different stage. There should be no mystique over conception as a substantial percentage of fertilized embryo's (a human life in your estimation) are going straight down the toliet when nature is left to take its course. At least the Catholic opposition to contraception can be viewed as being morally consistent, ie. there is no man-made intervention permitted in the human reproductive process.
