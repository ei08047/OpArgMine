Actually, there are three different definitions of biological evolution. Each of them is understood by biologists in its context without any need to elaborate. Each of these definitions are, of course, distinct and separate from other definitions of the word.
For example, your definition #1 isn't one of those definitions. Even though you begin with a claim about honest definitions of biological evolution, your first definitions isn't one of them. It is, in fact, more like the Victorian definition of the word than what it has come to mean today, and certainly not relevant to any biological definition. Your definition #1 is the reason that Darwin objected when the term was applied to his theories. It isn't what Darwin had in mind and it isn't what a biologist or anyone who understands biology means, even today. Either you don't know what you are talking about (most likely) or you are trying to raise a straw man (dishonest).
Of course, any fool can see that your definition #2 is circular. Stating that evolution is an evolutionary process doesn't actually define anything. While you object to embedding some undefined metaphysical postulate in a definition, you apparently don't have an objection to embedding the word itself in its own definition.
