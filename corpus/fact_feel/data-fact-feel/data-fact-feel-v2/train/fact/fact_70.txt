Again, ecological factors play an important role. If the first birds were aggressive carnivores that attacked other aggressive dinosaurs, this may hold water. Yet their skeletal structure suggest that they were small, agile and light dinosaurs equipped for eating insects and such. The Theropods actually had to gain muscle to provide powered flight which was a later development.
