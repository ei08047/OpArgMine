Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? 
It sounds to me that this "new" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find.
 ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in
the adapted strains.*...
