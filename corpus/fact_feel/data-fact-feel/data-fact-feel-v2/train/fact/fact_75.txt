Well for what it's worth, the police prefer to use AR-15 Carbines, MP-5 9mms, and either Mossberg or Remington 12ga when they are serving a no-knock warrant on your house (or the wrong house next door) in the middle of then night. And the AK may be a bit much for home use, as the 7.62 would way over-penetrate the walls and hit the neighbors houses (or the neighbors.) Hope that helped.
