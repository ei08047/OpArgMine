Yes that is a problem. But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders:
"Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast" - http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.html
If it wasn't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast, German if you live on the East coast.
