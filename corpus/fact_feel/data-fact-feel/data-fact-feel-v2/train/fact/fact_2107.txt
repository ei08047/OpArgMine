Actually, I had heard it several times on radio talk shows that normally do research before making claims. I then read it on several sites that cited the U.S. Census Records as their source. Since the radio shows and the websites all credited the U.S.Census, I perceived that they could not have made it up...since they all matched within acceptable tolerances. It does seem reasonable to you that such information could be gleaned from the census data...does it not?
Will you agree that what they say is true?
