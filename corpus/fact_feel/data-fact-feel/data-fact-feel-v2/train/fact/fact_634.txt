So, you post a press release from the brookings institute, one that they could not even get any news agencies to pick up and print, and then accuse me of biased sources? Thats pretty rich. 
There is a fair to decent article about this at http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.a...20030127a.html
Realistically, I don't know how many gun control laws there are nationwide. I know that the report cited by the brookings XXXXXX admits to ONLY reporting federal and state laws, but not local (I know that there are 34 local gun control laws where I live, including the all important one prohibiting you from carrying a shotgun into a feed store). This seems to me to be akin to counting up federal and state zoning ordnances and then claiming that there are only 300 laws about zoning in the US.
