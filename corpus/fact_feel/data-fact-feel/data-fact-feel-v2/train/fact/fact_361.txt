Like chemist and all other darwinists, you imply wherever possible. But in this case I broke my own best rule and replied to chemist, and was not speaking of you at all.
And you are right, the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, [inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms], as discovered by Cairns, et al, in 1988, is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation. I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work--
" Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage."
That was not Cairns, but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring, and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90's who did work on adaptive mutation, wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies. That is, somatic hypermutation as a cellular,[in multi-cellular organisms, such as eubacteria colonies], adaptive, systemic and systematic [non-randon, non-stochastic, non-accidental] heuristic evolutionary mechanism.
He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.
