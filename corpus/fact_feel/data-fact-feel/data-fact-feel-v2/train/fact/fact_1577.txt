Indeed.
If a teacher teaches 'the controversey' correctly, and lays out the facts and let's kids decide for themselves (is that done for ANY subject?), certainly, the most indoctrinated will say creation wins. But what about the open-minded? What about the students that can actually grasp the fact that creationism offers nothing in the way of supporting evidence? that is rests solely on trying to poke holes in evolution and appeals to biblical authority? Those students will conclude that creatiomnism is bogus, and may cause them to question their 'beliefs.'
Two things could happen:
1. the Right -wing zealots will enforce laws making it a crime to put creationism ina poor light, forcing teachers to bow down or be fired. Conservative correctness with the force of law.
2. the Right-wing zealots will realize that their little plan backfired, and let the issue die 
Scarily, if this should come to pass, if things do not change much politically, I see option 1 as the most likely.
During the Cold War, politicians had 'godless Soviet atheism' to rally against with religious fervor. The Conservatives are now latching onto Fundamentalist Islam as the new 'Red Horde'. And lots of gullible people are
buying into it.
