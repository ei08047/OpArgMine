Actually, might I say that you assume that the criminal had a firearm, correct? This may seem foolish of me, but I'll go along with you. Now, you can assume that a criminal doens't have the right mindset. There's always a first crime, but isn't it illegal for an ex-con, a drug addict/alcholic, or someone who has a few screws loose up there to own a firearm? So we could assume in your situation that the law wasn't enforced. So let's pretend like the law actually is enforced, shall we? What makes you think the criminal has a firearm? If he has a firearm, how do you know that it's because the law wasn't enforced? The solution is to put a bit of muscle into enforcing the laws we have now. You wouldn't be this guy, would you?
Oh, no, my house is on fire! I better throw some gasoline onto it!

Oh, no, that made it worse! There's some trees there that could burn the entire neighborhood down if they catch, so I better throw some more gas onto it!

Why isn't it working? You, over there! Yeah, you! Tell everyone that my house is fine!
