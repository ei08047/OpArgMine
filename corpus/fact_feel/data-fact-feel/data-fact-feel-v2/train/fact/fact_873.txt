Walking-fish:
A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist.
