This isn't my position. I'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish. Furthermore, if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine, then no police officer needs them either. If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter, then the police can do it too.
