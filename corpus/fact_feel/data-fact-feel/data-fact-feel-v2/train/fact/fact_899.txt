But at least Evolutionist can give physical proofs for their beliefs. It is right that nothing is completely sure and clear, but Evolutionists and Scientists have shown a lot more evidence that shows that Evolution is right, Creationists just can't show enough... (my opinion)
And it's right that most stuff Evolutionists are dealing with are millions of years old, but it still all makes more sense than some stuff in the bible...
There is no complete proof for any of the theories, but Evolution just gives more evidence...
And if Creationists just want some credit for their beliefs and work, they shouldn't want evolution to be deleted vom Education. No one knows what is right but right now the theories of Evolution just shows more evidence and is widely accepted and used...
