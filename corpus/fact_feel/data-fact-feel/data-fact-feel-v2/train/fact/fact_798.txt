The likely flaw of this argument is defining Communism. Communism as defined by Marx and Engel has never been implemented. Furthermore, Communism as defined by Marx and Engel IS democracy. Often people either forget that or have no idea what Communism is. Historically, Communist supporting ideology candidates that have won democratic elections have been removed by force (or attempted) by Western powers. Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, several African nations including Mozambique, the list is actually quite long.
