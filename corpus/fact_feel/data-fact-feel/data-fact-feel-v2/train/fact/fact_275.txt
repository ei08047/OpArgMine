Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality.
The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion "I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else" or "I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality.
