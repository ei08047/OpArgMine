Don't quote yourself.

Nothing is ever proven, except in math.
But, yes, papers are published all the time with loads of evidence pointing to the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs.
Alligators were not dinosaurs when dinos were around and still aren't.
Neither are monitor lizards. Btw- monitors started appearing right as the dinos died out, but they were not and are not dinos.
