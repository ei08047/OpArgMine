HOW we transitioned is by mutation and natural selection. The ability to walk upright gave us a better overview of the area, giving us more time to react if there was a predator around. It also freed up our hands, and we slowly began using tools more and more. As for WHEN this happened, I give you : Australopithecus afarensis
