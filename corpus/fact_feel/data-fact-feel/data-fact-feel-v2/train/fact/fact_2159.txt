I'd be happy to. The concept that I was trying to move forward was: the idea that - when we see a cecal valve develop, for example, we assume that it is newly engineered data to react to the new environment. Big question mark!
My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves, was its best chance of survival. So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go. Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat.
