Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.
