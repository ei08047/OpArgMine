Actually it was a watch on the heath. Yes, you can see the difference, but what is that difference? If you haven't identified it then you are as clueless as IDers are in how we detect manufactured artifacts.
However, IDers have given you a clue. They just ignore it themselves. This is from Behe's Darwin's Black Box:
"For a simple artificial object such as a steel rod, the context is often important in concluding design. If you saw the rod outside a steel plant, you would infer design. Suppose however, that you traveled in a rocket ship to a barren alien planet that had never been explored. If you saw dozens of cylindrical steel rods lying on the side of a volcano, you would need more information before you could be sure that alien geological processes -- natural for the planet -- had not produced the rods." Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box, pp 195-196
