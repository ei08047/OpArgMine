And that's almost certainly how things were at least once in the past: several hominid species migrating, competing, evolving - we're the descendants of the ones that won. That's what you fail to appreciate by continuing to insist that 'science says' fossil hominids are our ancestors. Science says no such thing. Science says this was Planet of the Apes - and we won.
Why are there still chimps, then? Because they weren't competing with us. Think: the same ecological reasons why chimps couldn't evolve our level of intelligence made it not worth our while to fight them for that territory. Doesn't that make beautiful, perfect sense? Only since we've started exporting our ecology, cutting down jungles and so on - only since then have we come into competition with them, to their cost. If we're not careful, the answer to the fatuous question "If we evolved from chimps, why are there still chimps" will be "there aren't".
It's silly to attach significance to the fact we're the 'only' intelligent species. For a start, we're not the 'only' - we're the first. Intelligence - our 'level' of it - was never inevitable; it's not some ultimate goal, any more than swimming or flying. But assuming it happens, someone has to be first, and we're it. Secondly, we're not the 'only' - we're the most. So far. And we're getting smarter - so don't be so quick to declare us the pinnacle; you have no idea what peaks are hidden in the clouds ahead. If we're lucky, in a million years the smartest creature will be one of our descendants, but it could just as easily be whatever creature emerges to claim the territory we leave behind when we become extinct.
