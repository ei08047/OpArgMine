And if it depends on "what definition of speciation you use," why didn't you give yours so that we can be clear as to what we are discussing.
Finally, macroevolution is not 'the concept that at certain times evolution makes huge jumps in genetic shifts that result in “new” species (an over simplification and there are many theories in specie formation).' Speciation does not require "huge jumps in genetic shifts," whatever that means (another example of semi-literate English). Would you like to hear of some examples of single populations in which the geographical extremes are separate species (i.e., they have overlapping ranges and are genetically isolated)?
