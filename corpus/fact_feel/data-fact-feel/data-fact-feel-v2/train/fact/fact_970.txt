You seem to feel that scientists care about "creation" more than they do. Neither Kettlewell nor Majerus mentions creation or even takes it into account. But you have believed creationists who probably don't know as much as you. Kettlewell's work was not a fraud. He did the best he could with what he had and presented his work in peer reviewed literature. His work has nothing to do with creation. But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing. Thus, when re-evaluation of Kettlewell's work is done and flaws are pointed out, creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation. Funny that it wasn't "creation scientists" who pointed out the flaws and it wasn't "creation scientists" who publicized them. It was done by two evolutionary biologists who didn't even mention creation.
