Actually gun crime in the UK is at a very low level. If you believe government statistics then gun crime is at its lowest level for years. Police travel in twos because it's easier to catch people when there's more than one of you. It's been standard practise for years in lots of countries. The armour is mostly stab-proof and is largely to counter the rise in gang-related knife crime. It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).
