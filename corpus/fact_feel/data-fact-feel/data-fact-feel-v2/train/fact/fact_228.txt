Okay, you are right... we need a definition for a 'hole,' as it is a bit of a subjective concept. Allow me to define 'hole' like this: The void created by the intentional destruction of something already in existence. Using 'hole' with this definition makes Alcorn's statement (minus the word 'terrible') a true fact in the physical realm. And it precludes any of your other ideas from creating 'holes,' since they all deal with potentiality, not reality.
