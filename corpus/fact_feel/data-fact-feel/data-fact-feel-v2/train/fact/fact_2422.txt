It's not an "arrogant assumption" to point out that religious faith involves
making a "leap in the dark" - it's a metaphor that attempts to illustrate
the facts of the case.
I'm saying that given ADEQUATE EVIDENCE, science, IN PRINCIPLE, can
answer all questions concerning the MATERIAL world. That is actually
quite a limited statement if you bother to read it carefully.
Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have
been accomplished in any other way, is not "raising science on a pedestal"
- it's merely reciting the obvious.
Yes, I am saying that reasoned arguments from anthropology can and do
account for the evolution of morals, the law, etc. in human societies. The
growth in complexity of physical organisms is analogous to the growth of
social complexity in human societies: the study of the former can throw
light on the development of the latter.
I have not tried to address the torrent of "points" that cascade into
the of rest of your post: I don't understand what you're talking about.
As for the allegation that I'm driven by "ideology" - I haven't a clue what
sectarian policies you think control me.
