see, in the US we have a thing called "laws" and these "laws" are what the courts are supposed to go by. What their personal feelings that have are not relevant to any court case (or shouldn't be that is). So yes, it was the correct decision based on the laws.
As a side note, if you wish to change a law we have a congress that does that.
