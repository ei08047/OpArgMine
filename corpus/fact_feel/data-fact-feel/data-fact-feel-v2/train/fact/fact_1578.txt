And again, but no other animal that can fly has also conquered breathing under water as we have, or has learned to travel on land faster than the fastest mammal can run. But we fly, breathe underwater and travel faster than a cheetah as if it was second nature. No other animal in creation has attained what we have, or even come close. As I said, only humanity has evolved past having to survive in the natural World as all other animals on Earth do.
