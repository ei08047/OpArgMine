Anti-Abortion
Hi, I'm brand new to this forum but not to abortion debates. I have been active in abortion debates for almost 20 years now. (not bragging, just providing some background) I started "online" debating even before the internet was available to the general public. We used a direct dial BBS called "FIDONET." (look it up on Wikipedia)
I used to be "pro-choice" with regard to elective abortion.  and the legality thereof. I was of the (seemingly very common) belief that many people express; "I wouldn't personally want my child aborted,.. but who am I to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body?"
Sound familiar?
Long story, short? My views started changing in 1989 when an up and coming radio talk show host issued a challenge. He (Rush Limbaugh) said that he believed that "a persons life (rights) begins at and by their conceptionm,,, and he wanted someone to prove to him that it can possibly begin any other way."
(I despised Rush Limbaugh)
That challenge began my education process on the many abortion aspects and issues... and I have been actively involved ever since.
I have already read through several of the threads (including this one) in this forum and I'm looking forward to participating,... and possibly incorporating it into my website. ChuzLife.net (under construction)
