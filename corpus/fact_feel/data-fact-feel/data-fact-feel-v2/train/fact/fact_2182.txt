I think you guys are missing out on the fact that the Judge ruled that there was not injury done to Donna Santa Marie. So much for the arguement that the unborn human is part of the mother. What a disgusting and unfortunate case. It wasn't born alive, so it doesn't matter.
What unsettles me the most is that some of you don't seem to care. You sound more worried about the possible XXXX to abortion than the women who have been hurt.
