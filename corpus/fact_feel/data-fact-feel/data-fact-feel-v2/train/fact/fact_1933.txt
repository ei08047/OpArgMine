And the follow-on that Archie throws out there demonstrates his ignorance on the subject.
Such laws DO NOT just protect homosexuals.
They protect EVERYBODY from being fired just cause they are gay OR straight (or bisexual or nonsexual).
It protects the straights just as much as it protects the gays.
It has nothing to do with "better than" or "superior".
If people like Archie understood legislation like ENDA, they wouldn't try to make such an absurd allegation! emoticonXEmbarrassed
