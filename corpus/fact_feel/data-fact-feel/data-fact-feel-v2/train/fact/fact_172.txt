Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a "curious relationship in the numbers." Go back to that thread and read the study. 
If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
