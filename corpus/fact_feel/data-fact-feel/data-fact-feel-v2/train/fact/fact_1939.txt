So now the definition of evolution is 'pre-existing genes switching on and off as needed for various environments?'
It is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me.
An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed. 
Switching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments.
There has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene.
The mutations are ALWAYS a net loss of information and as the genetic load continues - eventually all life will morphidite and die out.
The propaganda of the antibiotic resistant "Superbugs" was the biggest bunch of lieing nonsense of its time. There are still people who believe that too. They don't think - they believe.
