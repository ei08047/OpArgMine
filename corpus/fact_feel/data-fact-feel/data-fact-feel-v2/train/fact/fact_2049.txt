As for myself, I have serious concerns about research done by Lott.
"Lott has been unable to provide evidence to back up his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. When questioned Lott has changed his story several times about where he got the 98% statistic from. The validity of other statistics in his book are also in question because he didn't control for such factors as poverty and drug use. David Mustard, co-author of Lott's study, admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate. Gary Kleck, a pro-gun advocate and researcher, commented on this '[More]likely, the declines in crime, coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis'(Targeting Guns; p. 372).While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles, enough questions have been raised about Lott's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research."
