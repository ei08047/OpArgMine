No mark, no bullet hole nothing. Her and her father claim that I just touched my gun...which I didn't! They even testified at the preliminary that I didn't touch anyone nor did I make any threat what so ever. That I just put my hand on my gun. The police on the scene didn't charge me. They went to the Sheriffs Dept and took warrants on me and my mother. My wife got my mom for assault claiming she was trying to grab our daughter from her and was fighting with her. Yet again no marks.I even have evidence of premeditated revenge from threatening text messages days earlier from her dad and her saying stuff on myspace. She took out orders of protection on us but the judge dismissed them QUICK! We got indicted so now we're facing a plea hearing. The other judge made us take joint custody. Primary custody has yet been asigned. My lawyer is the best in the area and also a good friend of mine. He's trying to get it dropped before court. But they claim I just touched my Glock. That doesn't meet the statute really in these circumstances. The responding officers even thought it was BS.
