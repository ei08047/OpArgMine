Actually its a pretty accurate interpretation. Take for instance the money spent by the catholic church promoting abortion restrictions, yet their tax exempt status has never seriously been called into question, that I know of. The fact of the matter is a couple hundred G's is a drop in the bucket for an organization the size of the LDS church, so proving that it is a substantial portion of their activities under section 501 would be difficult at best.
