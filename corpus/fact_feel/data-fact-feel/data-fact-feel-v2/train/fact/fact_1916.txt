The source I cite is a Japanese Admiral who survived WW2, who took part in December 7. Those were his exact words, "We were not fools to step in quicksand". Meaning the officer was quite aware of civilian owned guns and yes they were afraid of grannies point shotguns out of kitchen windows. In China were there are no guns, the army was quite comfortable to rape and kill women and children at will. 
Iraq is handing the 82nd Airborne thier hinnie as we speak. The militia is not going to stand head to head on a battlefield. That is the job of the standing army, not the militia. The civilians and irregulars in Iraq are doing EXACTLY what the militia will do in the USA agains a forgein invader. If you haven't noticed more solidered have been killed from the irregualrs than on the battlefield. 
Sorry for the slow response I have been trying to prevent the homeless from freezing on the streets at night. I would not be going into the places where the homeless frequent at night if I did not have a gun. So there is one more reason why I carry a gun, to protect me while I save the homeless on the street.
