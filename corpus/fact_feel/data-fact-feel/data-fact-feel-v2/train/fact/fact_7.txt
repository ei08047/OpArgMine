The big bang theory actually describes the universe very well and is the best working model we have. No one has developed a complete model of the universe that can describe all observations. That doesn't make the model completely false, it just makes it incomplete.
Back in the day, Newtonian physics was dominant. Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.
I'm going to say it again: the model isn't wrong, its incomplete. Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations.
Big Bang merely describes the way the universe works, it doesn't make any predictions as to what was responsible for setting these events in motion.
