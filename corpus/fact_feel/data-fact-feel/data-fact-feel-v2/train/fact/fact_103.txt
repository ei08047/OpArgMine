The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word "phenomena" is vague. 
The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths.
