You can check the statistical relationship between dozens of variables, not the effects of them.
For example if I correlated left hand strength with right hand strength across a billion individuals I would probably find a correlation of about 0.93, however this relationship is not causal, cutting off one hand will not result in a 90% strength reduction in the other.
Correlational studies like this one can not determine cause and effect.
