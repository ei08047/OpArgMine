Actually, if you had paid attention, you would know that every example of IR given by Behe has been debunked. Immune system? Sorry. Debunked. There are examples of organisms with intermediate steps. Blood cloting cascade? Sorry. There are example of animals that accomplish clotting without all of the "necessary" factors. Bacerial flagellum? Sorry. Type III secretion systems appears to be a simplified sub-set of the bacterial flagellum's components.
If only you took the time to actually educate yourself rather than trying to pass off mythology as reality.
