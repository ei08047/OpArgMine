I highly doubt they throw them in the sink. They probably put them in a red plastic biohazard bag, tie it shut, and throw it on the pile of other red bags to be shipped off to a medical waste incinerator to be burned. May sound graphic and callous to you, but it is probably far more accurate that a "sink full of bloody baby remains". Why must the anti-abortion crowd use such fallacious images to sell their point?
