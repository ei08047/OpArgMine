Read the entire verse and don't edit out parts of it."When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city." Hmmmm...death or slavery. Wow, that's a hard choice.
