Actually new organs are developed only by MODIFICATION of existing ones. But those modifications are due to chages in the existing physical and chemical structures. New chemical structures can however arise easily by mutation. For example mutation of a single base in chloroplast DNA results in effectively total resistance to the microbial peptide tentoxin. One can indeed turn it on and turn it off with a little genetic manipulation. In addition the specific mechanisms involved are well described in the literature. Glad to supply a set of links if anyone really wants to read them, but will not do so unless requested. CF1 I might add is one of the most important body parts to be found anywhere - most of our food supply depends on its turbine like function.
