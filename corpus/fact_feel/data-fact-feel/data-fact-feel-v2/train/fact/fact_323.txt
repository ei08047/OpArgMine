Hello Aivlis, my name is Joe. Please let me tell you a little about my self. When I was twenty one I started dating my first girlfriend. She was seven years older then me. She had a seven year old little girl. I was working three jobs when we meet (one full time, two part time). Within six months she was pregnant (Yes we were stupid and did not use protection). I went out a bought a ring and proposed to her. She said yes. A short time later she told me she was going to get an abortion. I was devastated. I told her I would open a bank account in her name and have the pay from two of my jobs direct deposited into the account. I told her I would be there for her and our child. She still wanted to get an abortion. I told her I would raise the baby myself and that she would have no obligation, she still wanted to get an abortion. I told her I could not support her in this decision. The night before she went for the abortion, I begged her to reconsider. She would not. I wept like a baby because of this. I took me many years and the mercy and grace of God to heal from this life changing event. If there is anything I can say or do to get you to reconsider this please let me know. There are many people who would love to help you either keep your unborn child or find a safe loving home for him/her. My wife and I have a fifteen month old daughter, her name is Halley Raine. She is a real blessing, but she will never take the place of the child I would have had with my ex girlfriend. My other child would be about ten or eleven now. Please let me know if I can be of any help to you. What ever road you do decide to go down, I will be keeping you in my prayers.
