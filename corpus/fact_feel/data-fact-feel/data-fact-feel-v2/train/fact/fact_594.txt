I dont know how the negligence laws apply to First Aid in the states, but in Australia the situation is analogous. 
You can, as a trained first aider, walk down the street. You see a man with obvious severe injuries, who is screaming out for help. Until you accept the responsibility of helping that man, you have absolutely no duty of care to him.
Similarly, until a mother accepts the responsibillity of having a child, she has absolutely no duty of care to it. She can even carry it to term and give it up for adoption.
