So basically, you're saying you know they have a legal criteria for what constitutes civil rights, and in the same section you say you aren't a lawyer, and that you can't track it down. Interesting. Since you aren't backing it up and essentially admit that you can't, then your claim will be taken for what little it's worth. :)
