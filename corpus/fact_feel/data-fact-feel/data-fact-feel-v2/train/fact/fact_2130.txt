You've got it backwards, disorder in the universe is increasing, (see entropy).
An increase in complexity does not mean there is an increase in organized matter, the opposite is true.
A random pile of building material is more complex then a house which is created from that same pile of building materials, because that material is now organized.
To make matters worse, organized matter increases entropy because it takes energy to organize it.
