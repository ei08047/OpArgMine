#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.
#2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena. It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator. There are several theories about the specifics. I happen to think lightning was involved. 
#3 - It is thought humans evolved "away" from the other apes due to environmental pressures. When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate. That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our "rapid" and unprecedented brain development.
#4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes.
