Oh I quite agree. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to see it as such. I was admitting to those who don't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices. 
To back Traveler up however, I don't buy the 'closet case' answer myself. People who are racist aren't secretly scared they are black, equally homophobes aren't necessarily closet homosexuals. Unfortunately such irrational prejudices just exist.
