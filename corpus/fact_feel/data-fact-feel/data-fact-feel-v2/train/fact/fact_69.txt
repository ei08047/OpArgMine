No. That would be adaption. It wouldn't involve any genetic change. Another word for it might aclimatization. Your example shows little thought. The Polar bear's webbed feet are genetic. Even if a Polar bear lived it's whole live in a cage without ever going near water, it would still have webbed feet.
That really is absolutely the most ignorant thing I have ever heard. The water stretches the skin through friction! Don't you just love "creation science"? You get to make it up as you go.
