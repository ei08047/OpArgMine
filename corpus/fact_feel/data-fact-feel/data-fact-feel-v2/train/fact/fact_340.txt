I have posted responses to Demon38â€™s earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.
