Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.
