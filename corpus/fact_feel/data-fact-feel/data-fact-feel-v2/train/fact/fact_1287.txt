The Grand canyon could not have been created by a flood event, the geology is all wrong: http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-science.html
The flood explains nothing which cannot be explained by other, better-supported means and directly contradicts vast swathes of evidence:
Biodivesity and the fossil record are not consistent with the flood.
Genetic profiling is not consistent with the flood (in humans and animals)
The Ark could not hold all animal life.
A global mark would have left marks across the entire globe at a consistent time period; these marks are not found.
