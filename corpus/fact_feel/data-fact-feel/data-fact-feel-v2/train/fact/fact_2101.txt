"The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia. In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private. The public had a claim for public purposes. Coxe was a strong Federalist. He was employed in Hamilton's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion. He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms."

So Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton didn't agree. They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army. 
"Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war, as well for defense as for offense.... No militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist regular force.... The Firmness requisite for the real business of fighting is only to be attained by a constant course of discipline and service. I have never been yet been witness to a single instance that would justify a different opinion."
(Letter from George Washington to the President of Congress- September 15,1780)
"Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its
natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national
defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us our
independence. It cost millions to the United States that might have been
saved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance of
this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a
suggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and
disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the
same kind." -Alexander Hamilton
