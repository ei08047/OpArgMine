Just because we do not know the laws of logic does not mean they do not exist. I could debate someone and violate the laws of logic and claim I don’t have any knowledge of them and therefore they don’t exist for me.
Attacking the person again, not the argument, I guess atheists can make logical fallacies because it’s a concept that they can choose to not exist like the concept of “hofflenosh”
