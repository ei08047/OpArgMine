OK. Evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the knowable. It's by that definition, rational. The entire theory, as is all knowledge, is subject to evidence, not being self-contradictory (as your statements often are), and not contradicting some other validated knowledge. Evolution meets these requirements, and is therefore entirely rational. Anything else?
