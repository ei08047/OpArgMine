And you know what? No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human. One of the reasons they are different, and subject to different epigenetic regimes, is because despite genetic homologies (which evolutionary theory predicts), their genomes are significantly different. They have some different genes, in different quantities, and in different arrangements, and that is critical. Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation.
