You know, I'm all for punny jokes (even moreso than most people), but that's not what I meant. I seriously want a designist explanation for the development, as opposed to the Hovindian "it is an anchor point for muscles" explanation of its existence. (Although, it's not as if we don't have any examples that don't have that "problem.")
