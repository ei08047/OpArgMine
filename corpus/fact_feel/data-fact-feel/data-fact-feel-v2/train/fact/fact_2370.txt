Really? Let's go to the OP. You said "What this post explains is that Occam’s razor denies the accuracy of the bible because it makes too many assumptions to be more likely than the scientific explanation. Therefore, it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence."
Now, if we are not "to accept the bible", what are we supposed to do? 
"See my first example for a reason that we should keep our beliefs uncomplicated whenever possible. If we didn’t, we would be swamped with thousands of explanations for very simple events, and most of the explanations would be illogical."
What do you mean by "illogical". In context it seems that you are saying "wrong". Are you? If not, specify in detail how do you think an "illogical" belief would be correct?
"Except that Occam's razor is used for comparing hypotheses. "
Back to a scientific use of parsimony. What are we comparing them for? "Most likely" or for which hypothesis is true and which is false? I submit that you are being disingenuous. You actually mean that you can use parsimony to decide which hypothesis is true, but, when pressed that this doesn't work, fall back to "most likely".
So let me ask, how "most likely"? What are the odds? How do you compute them? Is "most likely" 51% ot 49% or 100% to 0% or somewhere in between? Or does it change for each situation? If "most likely" changes, then how do we know what you actually mean?
