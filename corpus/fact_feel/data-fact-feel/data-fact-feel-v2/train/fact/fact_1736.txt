An amount of violence miniscule in comparison to the violence caused by Christians intolerant of other religion; look to the Crusades and the Inquisition if you please. Look at the justification for the slaughter of Native Americans. Look even today at the ruthless murders of gay people.
But just as I would not judge all Christians by the actions of some, it is inappropriate to judge all evolutionists by the actions of some.
Overall, I don't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species, which is an interesting topic in itself.
However, if the author had proven that the world is young, the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time, for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution. If the author had proven that evolution hadn't occurred, then the most logical explanation that some similar, natural process is the cause. But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct.
See, the author has made a mistake fatal in debate: he has attack his opponent's viewpoint, then stated that since his opponent is wrong, he is correct. But that is not true, for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct.
I, for example, might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth, then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today. I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated, only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires, and I could have come to the same conclusion. Since the evolution is wrong, then I am right.
But that's just not good enough. Even if he had proved evolution were wrong, there is no more reason to believe in the supernatural than there is to believe in Vampires, Dragons, Pixies, or any other mythological creation. This doesn't mean that those things don't exist, just that there is no reason to believe in them.
