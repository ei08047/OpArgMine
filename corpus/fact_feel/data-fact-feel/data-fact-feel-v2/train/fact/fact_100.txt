You are perhaps thinking of the Miller-Urrey experiment. No one expected life to appear. They were merely curious about what would happen if they simulated the conditions of the early Earth.
Since then, we've found pretty much the same thing in the interior of stony meteorites, including an excess of L-forms. So, it's confirmed the findings of Miller-Urey. None of this has anything to do with evolution, however.
Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. This happens in populations; individuals don't evolve. Everything else in evolution is an elaboration of this phenomenon.
