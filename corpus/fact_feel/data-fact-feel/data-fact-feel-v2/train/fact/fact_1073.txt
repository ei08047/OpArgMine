Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings.
