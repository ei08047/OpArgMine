The page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to Dr. Raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a Creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here). Of course Dr. Raupâ€™s reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record, nor evolution, nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution.
The page also lists numerous other Creationist distortions of Dr. Raup's statements.
