Well if it has nothing to do with a militia that would mean that the preamble is merely unnecessary verbiage. So you want people to just ignore the plain text of the Second Amendment- at least the part you don't like. The preamble lets us know that the main focus if not the sole focus of this amendment is the militia. 
David Konig is another historian that has found both the individual rights interpretation and the collective interpretation unsatisfactory. He says the Second Amendment protects an individual right that is exercised collectively. 
"Indeed, to serve in the militia and participate in this civic duty was more than a duty: it was a civic right of a peculiarly eighteenth-century nature unlike either the 'individual' or 'collective' models argued for today. On neither side of the Atlantic, that is, did the debate concern itself with this right in the present-day sense of an 'individual' or personal constitutional right; but at the same time, its common emphasis on widespread individual arms-bearing for public service distinguishes it from today's narrowly applied 'collective' application to the National Guard. No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry. This type of right may appear paradoxical to us today, but it fitted 'the inner coherence of a given system of beliefs'4 held by people in the past, and which made sense to those familiar with the concept of an individual right exercised collectively."
