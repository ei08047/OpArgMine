You actually think Evolution works by what creatuers  want ? You think they just got up one day and said, "ya know Bob, I wanna evolve." !!Oops, there goes my tail!!
One want an organism can change is due to being in a different environment, isolated from the previous group. Mutations can occur, and if they aren't killer, they are passed on. Changes in genetic material through mutation add to the gene pool and are passed on through mating.
If you are an isolated group of animals, and you have enough mutations and mating, you will change over time. The environment, through one process, can choose who succeeds and who doesn't. It's natural selection. There are other mechanisms, of course, so that's not the only one.
We already know that Human brain development could possible have occured due to a new diet, in a new area. Meat allowed for a larget brain, which in turn allowed for better skills, compared to other animals. Humans used tools as well, which was aided by using hands. Eventually, these animals descended from the trees and ceased to be arboreal creatures, because they needed to use their hands for tools. You can't do that that well if you are swining in a tree.
