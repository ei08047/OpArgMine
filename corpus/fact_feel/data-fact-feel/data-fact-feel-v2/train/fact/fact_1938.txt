Well, PR on both sides will probably be gearing up on this, so which ever side does have the correct legal interpretation will probably be broadcasting it pretty soon now. It'll just be a matter of seperating the real answers from the bogus ones. Given how politcal the issue is I'm not going to accept any claims for correctness that don't cite actual specific law. As opposed, for example, to Romney simply saying "the constitution says they gotta".
