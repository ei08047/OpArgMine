Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5% of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95%, which is better than nothing. After that they can work towards stopping all abortions. It's a step-by-step process. 
I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal. 95% of abortions are a result of consentual sex. We shouldn't cater to the 5% just because they've had a tough situation. I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them, but they do still need to have the baby, whether they give it up for adoption or not. This isn't a horribly unreasonable position. It's just a difficult position. Saying it's alright to kill a baby for any reason is a horribly unreasonable position.
People need to face the facts too. Sex isn't there for pleasure, it's there for procreation and happens to be pleasureable. Someone who indulges in this pleasure should be ready to deal with the outcome, which oftentimes is a baby.
