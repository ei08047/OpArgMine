Well, since the composition of the uranium body when it was a natural reactor wasn't the same as today's natural uranium, it doesn't matter. What is important was the composition of the ore back then. Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.468E+9 years and U-235 has a half-life of 7.038E+8 years, it is apparent that the U-235 decays much more rapidly. It stands to reason that the The relative percentage of U-235 to U-238 was higher in the past. It also stands to reason that thee was more uranimum present at the time that the natural reactors were active. About 2 billion years ago the U-235 was about 3% or more of the composition of the uranium.
