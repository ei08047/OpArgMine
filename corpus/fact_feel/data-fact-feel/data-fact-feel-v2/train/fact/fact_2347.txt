Oh, yeah, the show went into this. They didn't really talk about T. rex that much at all. But they were pretty sure that the feathered dinosaurs must have been "warm-blooded" or somewhere toward truly warm blooded.
There are still some animals today that aren't all the way (but dinos, or some dinos, could have been all the way, who knows?)
