First of all, why would you take humans out of consideration? Doesn't the verse I posted above show where in addition to God blessing Adam and Eve in marriage, it speaks of God giving humanity dominion over every creature on Earth which humanities personal history is evidence of actually happening? 
So since we are made in Gods image:
Gen 1:26 Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
And notice how here, as He decides to create us in His image, He repeats Himself by giving us the same authority over all living things as He did when He blessed Adam and Eve and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply 2 verses later at Genesis 1:28? So just because homosexuality is found in the animal kingdom, who also never sinned against God and fell from grace by the way, it's irrational to compare animals sexual habits to Mans as we are made in Gods image and live by different morals and values than animals do. And btw, welcome to the forum. emoticonXGood
