Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist isn't it? Or for any Christian. The Bible says that God cannot lie. 
Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 
You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again:
Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted. 
Consider this excercise in logic:
If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie? If light didn't exist, and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said "let there be light, and there was light" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?
In the Bible, Jesus says "I am the way, the Truth, and the light". How can someone "be" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice. You see, if any part of the Bible is a lie, then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards.
