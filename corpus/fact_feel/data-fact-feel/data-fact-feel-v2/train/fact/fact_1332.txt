But that's not even how "creation science", or any religiously motivated science works. There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc. It doesn't matter if there is a better explanation available that does not involve mythology and superstition, if observations can be made to fit the religious scenario, it is evidence. Again, there is no checking of facts, i.e., no testing, and of course, no predictions.
