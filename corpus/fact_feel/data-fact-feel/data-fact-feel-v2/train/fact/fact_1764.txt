Thank you for your reply kelvin90701.
I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon, for now, I am just leaving, so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post. Specifically, the following:
The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.
So, what you are saying, is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons. That is, it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns? 
If so, would it still be OK, for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere, etc?
Again, thank you for your response.
