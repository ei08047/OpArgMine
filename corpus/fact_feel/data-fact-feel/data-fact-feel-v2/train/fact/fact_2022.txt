parcum, they are like any other medical facility, saying this is like saying that just because my physician just happens to be do some surgeries, he will always tell me I need to have a surgery- because of course, he will make more money off me then. You dont like the fact that planned parenthood performs abortions, and so you feel the need to slanderize them. Some rabid pro=lifer told you that, and you swallowed it hook, line and sinker. You obviously have no clue into the idea of customer service- which is the field I work in. You try to do whatever is in the best interest of the customer, even if it sends them to your competition. IN the case of planned parenthood, it is against their policy to recommend that a patient do anything but dicuss it with their own support system, be that friends, family, clergy or whatever. Any employee of theirs who breaks that policy is making them liable for legal recourse, and will also be likely to lose their job.
I wonder, does your high school offer logic courses? Please do us all a favor and invest in one.
