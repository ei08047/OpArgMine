In the theory of evolution, it all started with life. I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution. It's not. The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars "evolve" in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.
Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the "theory of evolution," it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time.
