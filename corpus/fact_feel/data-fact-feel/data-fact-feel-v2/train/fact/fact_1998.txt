Uhm, where does this say that the earth rotates? Nowhere. Simply speaking of morning or dawn does not show knowledge of earth's rotation. In today's world it does, but not back then. 
In fact, the verse our Creationist conveniently left out says the the Earth has edges ... this is probably more flat earth mentality, like the four-cornered earth mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.
PS: And while we're at it, let's not forget about the things that Bible gets completely wrong, like bats being birds (Leviticus 11:13-18).
