The scope of the conference was ONLY the discussion of illicit weapons trade on the international market. It had nothing at all to do with the ownership of weapons by private individuals EXCEPT as it pertained to the illicit sales of arms on the international market.
THATS IT. NOTHING ELSE. They were not debating private ownership of arms, and such debates were discouraged. When a group from handgun control inc. attempted to give a presentation, they were politely told that the the scope of the conference did NOT include privae gun ownership by individuals.

They run from word hunger to economic reform to higher educational standadrds. There is nothing there about guns.

You can also get a newsletter from them that is mailed right to your door every day to be read at your leisure.
I don't really have any feelings about the UN one way or the other. They are a large force that helps shape world politics, so I follow what is going on there.
