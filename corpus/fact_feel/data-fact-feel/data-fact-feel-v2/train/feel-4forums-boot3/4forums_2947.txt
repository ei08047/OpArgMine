Another nail in the case to seal the borders. Relatively easy to spot the cure unless one is terminally stupid. If a country has a problem is it the job of the USA to solve it for them or is it up to the country with the problem? The answer is easy unless you are of a leftist tilt. In other words not the problem of the USA. Only a liberal could think it was.
