Its not at all necessary to resort to calculations or any other scientific refutation. You cannot refute that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being could in fact flood the earth on a whim. The claims and assertions as to the properties of the being negate any possible scientific refutation since they deny that the laws of physics etc are inviolable. GOD can do whatever he chooses with absolutely NO restrictions - so a flood is well within his capacity.
