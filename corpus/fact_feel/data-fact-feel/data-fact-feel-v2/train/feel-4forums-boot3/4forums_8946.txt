the guy may of been commiting a felony... by trying to rob this fello..  But this fello committed many more serious crimes.. by getting that kind of revenge..  I find the story very unplausable....  The gas station would have pictures...  The risk of damaging the car.. is just dumb.  The phone calls and threats would yield 20 years...  and posting on craigs list, leaves a trail...  And the FBI.. would certainly follow up.. and chase this would be good guy down and give him those 20 years.  its one thing to defend yourself... thats fine.  Its another to commit worse crimes than the bad guy you oppose.  im not impressed.  -Mosheh Thezion
