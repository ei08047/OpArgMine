I'm always honest! It would become a completely atheist planet in no time - what makes the earth different is Christ's teaching and actions while he was here, and the following ACTS of those who witnessed it. His Disciples (mainly Peter) were scared little rabbits while he was alive, and after his resurection, weren't afraid of anything. That historical fact and other similar ones have had quite an impact for Christianity. The debate about whether God exists or not isn't only about the origin/science debates.
