And yet, in this case, your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage. And you aren't outraged by that? That's what I don't understand. The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify', but didn't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage!  I would think you'd want to know WHY he's against gay marriage. Particularly since he's your preferred candidate, and gay marriage seems to be a very important issue to you. But hey, maybe you don't care!
