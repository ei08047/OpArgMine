Many of us view humanity with mental existence as important. The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence.

Are you  harming  a brain dead body that is being artificially kept alive on a machine by unplugging it? Also, if the potential of a pre-mental-existence fetus is important to you, why isn't the potential of a unfertilized egg?
