Papers on individual cars are issued by the manufacturers when the car is completed, and before purchase. IMO, that is the more accurate analogy to the certificate denoting a human being's full development (at the factory), ability to birth, and having done so.  Then parent/s get a social security number (registration) and drive it off the lot or head home from the hospital. (Roughly speaking, though children are allowed to register later without penalty)
