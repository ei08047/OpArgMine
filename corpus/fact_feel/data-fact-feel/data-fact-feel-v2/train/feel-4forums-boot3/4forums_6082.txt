So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable, based on that individualÂ’s memory.  Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday, but today those memories are gone. For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age, but today, looking back, I did not have personhood until I was 6. As I age and my memory fails, it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old. Personnhood comes and goes.  Do I have it right?
