I'm not discounting secular organizations. I'm discounting atheists. They **** and moan about the wicked Christians trying to run their lives but don't pony up when others need help. Christians lend a hand in spite of all their supposed wickedness, but atheists are typically a bunch of cheap windbags. They speak of  intrinsic morality  not being religious-based, but don't display an ounce of it when push comes to shove.
