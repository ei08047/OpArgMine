You mean Intelligent Design, and straight forward logical, rational, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out...
