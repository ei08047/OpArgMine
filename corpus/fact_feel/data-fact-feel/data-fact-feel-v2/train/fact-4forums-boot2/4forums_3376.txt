I don't see where you are getting that Adam was not the first human being. Genesis 1 is the account of God's creation, and on the sixth day He created man. (Genesis 1:26-30) Genesis 2 is the account of when the heavens and earth were created. This chapter explains how He created man.  The Lord God formed the man(Adam) from the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.  (Genesis 2:7) This explains that God is the giver of life and He is the only one who can breathe life into something.
