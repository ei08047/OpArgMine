Maybe both parties posting evidence to back up their claims would work?  Personally, I'm all for legalising weed. The same cannot be said for harder drugs (someone taking them once under social pressure, for example, can easily destroy someone?s life. I?d rather not have them that available). The pros of legalising weed (money saved on combating it, money gained form taxing it etc,), outweigh the costs, even if use does increase.  -Wez
