Thomas favored incorporation through priviledges and immunities, correct?  That likely makes the most sense but the Court probably feared how far that could go, since the logical conclusion is the abolition of individual State law. Not that the  substantive due process  is well defined, but likely the Court felt they could rein in any excesses through that interpretation.
