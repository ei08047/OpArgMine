You see the physical manifestations but there's nothing that can be shown that God still cannot cause an earthquake or flood when he wants to. For instance, is he the one who can tweak a continental plate when he wants to, or cause flood-related weather patterns?  See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.
