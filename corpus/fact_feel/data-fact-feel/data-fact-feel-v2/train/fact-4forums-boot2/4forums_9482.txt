I thought races were created at the Tower of Babel, not by a loss of genetic information. Oh wait, of course, that's how the FSM did it, but the Christians have it all wrong. This mutation was not created by His Noodly Appendage at the Tower of Babel at all. It was the Pillar of Barilla. Must be an old mistranslation.
