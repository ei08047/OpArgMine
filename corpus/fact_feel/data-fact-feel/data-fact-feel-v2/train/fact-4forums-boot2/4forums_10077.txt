What's even more laughable is that for each of ark guy's examples, the modern species are very different than the species found in the fossil record. For example, the Mesozoic coelacanths aren't even in the same genera as the modern species.  Edited to add:  This is from dinofish website (click on  biology and behavior  and then on  evolutionary puzzle ).
