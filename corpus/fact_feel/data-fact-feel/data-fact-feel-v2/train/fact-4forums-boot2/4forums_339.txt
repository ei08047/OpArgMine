Women can die giving birth too.  Are these women forced into viewing the ultrasound, and only choosing to go ahead because of guilt, or is it their choice? Also, studies have shown that being denied an abortion causes long term psychological effects on women, compared to some women experiencing short term psychological effects who have gone through abortion. Just curious, what are these 'physical' after-effects you mention? And if you quote a site, don't bother quoting a biased pro-life one.
