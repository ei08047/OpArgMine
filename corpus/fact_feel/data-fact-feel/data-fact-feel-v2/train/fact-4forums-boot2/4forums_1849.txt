And there is the difference. The postings I was particularly speaking of have to do with court decisions (such as Cruikshank) where hlaf a paragraph, entirely out of context, is quoted to support the anti-gun viewpoint.  I have looked at the major anti-gun web pages, I recognise a cut and paste job when I see one. Cutting and pasting a bunch of statistics is one thing, doing the same and making it your entire argument is ignorant.
