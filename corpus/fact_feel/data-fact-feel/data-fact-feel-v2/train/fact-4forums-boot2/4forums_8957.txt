There are lot's of things that conduct electricity to some degree or another.  Polysilanes, for just one example, has a backbone of -Si-Si-Si-, and conducts because the sigma orbitals of Si are diffuse enough to overlap.  It's this de-localization of electrons that allows for conductivity.  If a carbon polymer has a lot of double/triple bonds or benzene rings then it should conduct.  Just like graphite, which is much more conductive along the a and b axes (the axes where the graphene planes lie) because of all the electronic delocalization.  But it's a poor conductor along the c-axis, because there are only weak pi-pi interactions and little orbital overlap.  Sulfur, I suppose would be a poor candidate for the basis of life.  The only times it forms more than two bonds is if it is bonded to a very electronegative atom like oxygen or fluorine. Also, it does not catenate very easily, and if it did, it would just be a chain of sulfur (no longer than 8 atoms long) with practically no functionality.
