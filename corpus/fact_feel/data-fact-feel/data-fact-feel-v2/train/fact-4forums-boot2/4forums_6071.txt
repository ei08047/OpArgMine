again, this is only good as a reasonable assumption, and nothing more. in many cases, the least likely answer is true. you cannot create evidence out of assumptions. you test the assumptions against reality, then the assumptions can be confirmed. i agree that reasonable assumptions are useful, but basing an assumption upon another assumption causes the likeliness to decrease.  for example, under the assumption that (a) jesus is devine, and that (b) God exists, it is likely that (c) jesus performed miracles. c can only be considered a reasonable assumption of a and b were already true. since a and b are assumptions themselves, then it makes c much more unlikely.  as opposed to the case of the footprints. if (a) people wear shoes and (b) there is a footprint in the lawn, it is likely that (c) a person stood on the lawn. in this case, a and b are verifiable, and by they being true, we can consider c a reasonable assumption
