Simple solution: Schools should be allowed to have their personal authority back over children during school hours. Now they can do nothing but point a finger and shake it and that's it. However they do find it perfectly reasonable to suspend someone over: a drink, shirt, hair color, drawing or something else completely useless that doesn't hurt anyone.  Reason behind all the current school failures in authority: Too many liberal teachers.
