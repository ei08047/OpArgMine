Sickness is all in the eye of the beholder, what I find sick you may well not and I think we have seen that I find things acceptable that you don't. I will not condemn any of it however unless it actually causes harm.  Oh I quite agree. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to see it as such. I was admitting to those who don't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices.  To back Traveler up however, I don't buy the 'closet case' answer myself. People who are racist aren't secretly scared they are black, equally homophobes aren't necessarily closet homosexuals. Unfortunately such irrational prejudices just exist.
