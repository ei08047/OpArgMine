But if there are too many dogs wandering around they do not change to be cats, or rabbits, or humans do they. They do not change so as to have eight legs and spider eyes do they. But yes development of the phenotype is a result of the genetic heritage interacting with the environment, but its not an intelligent process. If you starve a young organism to near the point of death and then rescue it with food it will not develop as if it had food when it needed it. It will not express its full genetic potential. The environment OFTEN changes the outcome of development by imposing limits on reaching the biotic potential provided in the genome.
