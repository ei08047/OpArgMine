Me neither.  I've even wathc an entire Christian conservative documentry on the  science  of creationism. Funny enough there wasn't a single scientific fact presented to support creationism, they merely tried to use  science  to disprove evolution. Which is absurd, given that all their facts were wrong.  Creationist work on the premise of selective data backed by faith, versus theory that is backed with data.
