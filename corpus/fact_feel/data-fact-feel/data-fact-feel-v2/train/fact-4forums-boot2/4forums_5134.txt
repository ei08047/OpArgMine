Then by your own admission the OT is irrelevant to todays standards?  All I know is that the bible is being used as a weapon against my people by people who only believe the bible is the  LIVING WORD of GOD  when it is convenient. They igonor certain parts they consider irrelevant to their modern lives while adhering to the other parts as the literal truth, without taking the whole book into historical and cultural context. Either the bible was written for a certain time and place or all, and I mean all, is the literal  LIVING WORD of GOD . It can not be both.
