Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?
