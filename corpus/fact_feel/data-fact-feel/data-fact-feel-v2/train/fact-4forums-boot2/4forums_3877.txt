I think there is a difference in saying what you must have and saying what you can't have.  Ok, does this apply to only businesses? What if the advisory panel says  in order to maintain health for the state, every citizen is required to own a toothbrush .  A free society works by saying  you can't do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys . If you go around saying  you must do it this way  then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead.  It is just inconsistent.
