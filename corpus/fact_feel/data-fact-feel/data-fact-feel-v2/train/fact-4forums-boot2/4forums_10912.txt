This is a false dichotomy. We are limited by the English language on this subject as  beginning ,  before  etc all reference time. Time is just a dimension of space-time however, thus something could have existed  before  (in a non-time sense) the beginning of space-time. So we might have had an absolute beginning, a partial beginning, or no beginning.
