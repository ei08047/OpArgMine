You listed the wrong website it is from the YCLUSA, they never talked about Stalin, and China and Vietnam have less laws limiting Capitalism than the US does so thay don't count. Oh yes and I as a communist have read more than this like Communist Manifesto,Das Kapital, and The State and Revolution. and I have read much history of the USSR and I frequently visit a communist forum.  And I have read the Soviet documents from the 30's,most  Modern Information  comes from Nazi William Hearst, Robert Conquest, and The Fascist Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
