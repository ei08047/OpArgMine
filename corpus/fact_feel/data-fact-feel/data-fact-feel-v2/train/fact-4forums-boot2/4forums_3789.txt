Here's a picture of it  http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galle...re/161_632.jpg  The specimens have been dated between 120 &amp; 140 my. If at the upper end of that range that puts it very close to the age of Archaeopteryx (140 to 170 my).  But contrary to what creationists like to claim, this isn't a problem. There is no claim that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to Confuciusornis. If you look at birds now you will see lots of different species. They have a common ancestor but are not descended from one another. Archaeopteryx is just the oldest example of a bird that we have, and considering the distance between the sites where the fossils were found, and possibly several million years in time, I would expect them to be different.
