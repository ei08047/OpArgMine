Holy See needs to realize that what it says rarely makes its way into domestic policy.  Just because they are catholic doesn't mean they are bigots.  Spain may realize that true freedom cannot allow denial to a minority merely because of irrational reasons.  Not to mention Spain may realize this represents a higher tax base. Socialists may be misguided, but they aren't stupid.
