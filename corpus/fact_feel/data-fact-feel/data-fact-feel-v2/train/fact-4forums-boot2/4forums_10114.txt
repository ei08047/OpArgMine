so do you think the Soviets, er -- silly me -- I mean Darwinists, will put 2 + 2 together and proclaim to the world that since one's environment (diet, environmental toxins, etc) can cause disease that one could eliminate/control this disease by eliminating the environmental source that's causing it?  I think this would explain why cancer is getting to be so wide-spread in society and why younger and younger people are developing it. The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves...as Dr. Bruce Lipton says,  It's the environment, stupid.  Of course if this little secret got out (that people could cure themselves by changing their internal and/or external environments) then Big medicine, including millions and millions of people would be without a paycheck. We can't have that. The sad thing though, as your article indicates, is disease doesn't just end with the person who has it...diseases often get carried forward into future generations, making children (and their children) more vulnerable.
