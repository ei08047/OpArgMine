Not in this instance, no. It isnÂ’t trying to parallel pregnancy per se(though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months), but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent. If the pro-life mantra is to be believed, it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do. So, the argument is applicable for 9 days, 9 months, 9 years or forever.
