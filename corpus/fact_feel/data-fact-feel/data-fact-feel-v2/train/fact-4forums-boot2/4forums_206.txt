MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES  Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word Â“carryÂ”Â–a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English DictionaryÂ’s twenty-sixth definition of Â“carryÂ” is Â“bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.Â” 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. WebsterÂ’s defines Â“carryÂ” as Â“to move while supporting,Â” not just in a vehicle, but also Â“in oneÂ’s hands or arms.Â” WebsterÂ’s Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And BlackÂ’s Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase Â“carry arms or weaponsÂ” as  Â“To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.Â” BlackÂ’s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).  These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the Â“carrying of armsÂ” to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person Â“carries a weapon.Â” But to say that is not to deny that one may also Â“carry a weaponÂ” tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.  Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word Â“carriesÂ” in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of Â“carry,Â” a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column Â“carriesÂ” the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.
