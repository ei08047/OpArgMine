Nope not kidding. Matter has a CONTINUUM of complexity. At some point in that CONTINUUM we assign (in a rather imprecise way) the property of Life to the matter concerned. Other less complex matter is assigned the abstract property dead or non-living. If you were more familar with the true range of complexity which matter exhibits you would be aware that the division is rather arbitrary. For example people have much difficulty on agreeing on whether viruses are living or non-living matter. And its clear that while you cannot analyze complexity in matter that it does exist. Its there and its real and its a lot more real than simple taxonomic categories like lfe and non-life are.
