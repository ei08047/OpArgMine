lol....With regard to slavery, the Civil War was fought to establish the principle that  All men (persons) are created equal.  A fetus is a unique and individual person whose location happens to be inside it's mothers womb. If all persons are created equal, one person does not have the right to descriminate and destroy another person solely because of their location or because they are smaller.
