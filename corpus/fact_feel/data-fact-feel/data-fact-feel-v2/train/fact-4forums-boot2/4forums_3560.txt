Besides being terribly wrong, that's not evolution and has nothing to do with evolution. Perhaps because you know so little about orbital physics you think that the sun rising and setting is any kind of evidence for the earth orbiting the sun. It isn't. You would have to actually understand a little about it to know that. Nobody, from Copernicus onward, used observations of the revolution of the earth to conclude that the earth was in orbit around the sun.
