Following your link, Ive just been  visiting  the website of  Doctor  Hovind and his associates: I found it a lot of fun - a sort of Disneyland of  creationist science .  Of course the good  doctor  takes advantage of almost universal ignorance about the scientific foundations of evolution: this is a melancholy fact, and it takes the edge off the laughs I had.
