I think others corrected you nicely on the future thing, but I would like to add that the only way humans are the only sentient beings is if we define sentient as something only humans are. If sentient merely means self-aware, I can't tell my cat's self-awareness from my own, so I really couldn't say who's sentient and who's not.
