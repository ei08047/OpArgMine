It is called the 1st amendment under the freedom of religion, under the 14th with equal protection, and the full faith and credit clause.  As I have said many times before I would be alright with marriage being limited to breeding age heteros because it would then exclude heteros also. However as long as non breeding heteros, and heteros past breeding age can get married then gay people must have that option also.
