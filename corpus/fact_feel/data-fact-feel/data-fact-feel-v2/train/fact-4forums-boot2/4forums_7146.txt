So tell me....knowing that the human race is 99.9% the same, and that  No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person's genes, they can't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one  racial  group or another ....how can you justify how the racist scientists can hold up a skull and make judgements about it? How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different  species  based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, monkey-loving, chance-worshipping, racist fools.
