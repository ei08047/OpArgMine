Well, then. They're not TROO christians. Just ask a certain poster on this board. When I told this certain poster that I have known several clergymen from several Christian denominations who accepted evolutionary theory, that's what he told me.  That certain poster and others would rather claim Newton, who was an arian, as a christian rather than clergymen who accept the divinity of Christ. Those clergy just understand both science and religion better.
