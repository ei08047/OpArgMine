Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words  evolution of the universe  do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.  But claiming that the  evolution of the universe  is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?  By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention  GTE  referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity.
