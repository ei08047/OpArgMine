No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.
