I'm not sure how demonstrating that anti-abortion campaigners have managed to get laws enacted to claim full human rights for the feotus in other circumstances actually adds anything to a debate over whether it should have them. It's a simply an appeal to authority which is a logical fallacy. That's not to say that the feotus isn't fully human, just that that text does not prove it.
