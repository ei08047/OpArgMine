When was the last time there was ever a mass murder at a gun range full or armed patrons? Or an International Practical Shooting Confederation match? Or any of our shooting sports that people come from all over the world to take part in?  If the  gun culture of America  is truly to blame for all these campus massacres, how come none of the shooters ever seem to be members of the NRA, or took part in a hunter's safety course, or anything else along those lines?
