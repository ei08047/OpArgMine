Here, the atheist satirists assign perfection to Â“astronomersÂ”. They have no comprehension of God being above and beyond Â“timeÂ”, and this causes them to feel that theyÂ’re on the same level as God, able to question him and challenge him to the same extent he can question us and challenge us. Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves cannot explain, though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact, non-controversial science.
