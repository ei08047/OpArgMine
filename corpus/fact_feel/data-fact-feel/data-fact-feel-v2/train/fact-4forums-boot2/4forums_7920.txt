There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction.  As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the  Son of God  and the  Son of Man , which means  Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.  I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.  Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws.
