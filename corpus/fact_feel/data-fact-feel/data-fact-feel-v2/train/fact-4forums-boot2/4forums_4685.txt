Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called  creation science  and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards.
