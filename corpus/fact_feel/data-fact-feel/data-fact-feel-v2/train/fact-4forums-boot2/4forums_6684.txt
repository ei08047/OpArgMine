Not wanting to appear insensitive, but XXX is she doing having a 4th child if she can't even support the first 3? I don't buy a 4th car if I can't afford the upkeep, why should children be different?  It's the entitlement mentality that caused our current problems with illegitimacy and keep the poor chronically poor. She doesn't need an abortion, she needed birth control/sterilization prior to becoming pregnant.
