Now back to the thread. Excellent post Sarge.  I do take notice of how it could have started a conversation about how we could and should be talking about ways to lessen B on B crime, but instead we got some misdirection.  Crime factors from the FBI website  Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of their criminal predators. What do you say you work for changing these conditions instead.
