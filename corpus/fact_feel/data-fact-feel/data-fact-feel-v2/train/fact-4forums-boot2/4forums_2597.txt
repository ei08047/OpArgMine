So newborn babies only have no Christian beliefs because Satan has removed them?  My position would be that the 'natural' (read:before external influences) state of a person is atheism, for the same reason that you 'naturally' have no belief in gremlins. People aren't born with beliefs, they are naturalised into them - whatever that belief may be.
