Oh dear. We once again see the fallacious 'information' argument being used. The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'?  And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.  This is pretty much meaningless without elaboration.  Meaningless analogy as you are talking about deterministic chemical reactions, not the equivalent of  1000 books  whatever that is supposed to suggest - for example, in the context of chemistry, how do you know that a reaction  equivalent to copying 1000 books  is difficult or uncommon?  Well, no, as evolution is not a random process, but then you wouldn't know that would you?
