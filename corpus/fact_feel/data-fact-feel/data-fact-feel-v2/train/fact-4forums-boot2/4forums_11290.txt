The roots of gun control in America have racist roots. Clayton Cramer, a black Georgetown University Economics professor, wrote an excellent brief documenting the Racist Roots of gun control for the Heller case. I doubt if people will want to read that many pages, but the Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership have an excellent 20 min video though.  I know some on the Anti side will claim that this group is too radical, but yesterday's shooting only highlights the reasoning?s for why they are so adamant about NOT being disarmed.  They are truly being targeted!   No Guns for Negroes
