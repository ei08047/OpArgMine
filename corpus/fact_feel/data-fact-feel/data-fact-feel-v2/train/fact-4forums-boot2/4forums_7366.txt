I Believe that the world will reach a certain heat, (warm enough to melt enough ice to stop the gulf stream) at which point the UK and Europe will dramatically cool to a more siberian temp. If Anyone who reads this has seen the film  the day after Tomorrow you may think im this science fixtion. However after researching on the possibility i discovered that if enough fresh water were to flow south to the Gulf Stream it would be cut off sue to the different densities and such.  Any Comments?
