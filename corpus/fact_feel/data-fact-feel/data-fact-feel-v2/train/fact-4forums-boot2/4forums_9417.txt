This judge stated that it was UN-Constitutional (according to California Constitution) to limit marriage to opposite-gender couples.  So . . . . . why did we vote in 2000 on the definition of marriage? And since the majority stated that marriage was between one man and one woman - why was that not taken into consideration with this ruling?  Why is it that when the people speak their voice, it is IGNORED?? Not only the mayor of SF - but this Superior Court judge as well?
