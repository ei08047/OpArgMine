Buying guns  Conditions under the 1999 Gun Act  To purchase a firearm in a commercial shop, one needs to have a Waffenerwerbsschein (weapon acquisition permit).  A permit allows the purchase of three firearms. Everyone over the age of 18 who is not psychiatrically disabled  (such as having had a history of endangering his own life or the lives of others) or identified as posing security problems,  and who has a clean criminal record (requires a Criminal Records Bureau check) can request such a permit.
