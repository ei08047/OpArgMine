It is said that the gvt. wants to take away the rights of the people to bear arms. I don't mind some restrictions on guns, but this down-right outragous. Just wait till the NRA gets their lawyers. I was reading about it earlier, the NRA won't let it stand. They are already preparing the case. GO GUN FREEDOM!
