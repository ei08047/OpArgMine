Lets pretend for the moment that the Eddie Eagle program is some sort of indoctrination, a point you have utterly failed to demonstrate. The Eddie Eagle program would be indoctrinating them into safety and responsibility around firearms. How does this in anyway compare to the forced indoctrination of a countries youth into the hate filled, facist teachings of a dictator?  That particular leap of logic cannot be made by any reasonable person.
