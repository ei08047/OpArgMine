Daley hasn't done anything to effectively combat the infestation of violent gangs and drug dealers within his city. It's now reached the level that Chicago is the most violent and deadly city in all of Illinois. The police are overwhelmed and underfunded, the people are sitting ducks, people are being shot to death in night clubs, and the city isn't so much as lifting a finger otherwise.  This is a disaster, the police are overwhelmed. And if we've gotta let the military open fire on the violent gangs to help restore order, then so be it! Kill the cancer or let it kill you.
