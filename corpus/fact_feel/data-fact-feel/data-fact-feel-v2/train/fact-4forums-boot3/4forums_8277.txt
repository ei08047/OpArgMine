1) Charliegone's article was a published research article.  I would love to know where  NARTH's  editorial was published, if it even was published.  2) NARTH's article DID NOT show any  higher homosexual activity  because of legalized gay marriage.  It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY  gay marriage  country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it.
