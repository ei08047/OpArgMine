No, the animals came to Noah because God commanded two of each kind to do so. Except for the ones that were supposed to come in sevens, even though all animals ended up coming in twos. (That's what happens when you combine similar but not identical stories...) Kangaroos and wallabies trekked from Australia, swimming to Southeast Asia and traversing subcontinental jungle to hop aboard. Whales and manatees swam right in through the window. And of course, after God had killed  every thing that is in the earth,  a dove managed to find a live olive leaf as a sign of receding floodwaters.  The rest can be explained by God-magic, of course. Don't be silly.
