A facinating way of framing it I should say. I could simply reply that pregnancy is preventable, that it is not a permanent condition and if one is patient it will end with the child's birth. I could also point out that the fetus is not responsible for the pregnancy in that it did not decide on it's own to come into existence and plant itself in the mother's womb but rather it was the mother and father that made the child through their actions so why is it made to pay the ultimate price?
