To me,  Theistic evolutionists  is an extreme contradiction. I mean, either you have faith that the Bible is the true word of God or you don't. I don't see how you can pick and choose what you care to believe out of the Bible. How can one believe in the miracle of Jesus' birth and resurrection yet not believe that Adam and Eve were real people? I find it a contradiction to somehow believe that God is great enough to create the universe, yet He somehow needed billions of years to do so. If God is all-powerful, then His words should be all that's needed. To me, the world is proof that God is all-powerful. The beauty and complexity is just staggering.
