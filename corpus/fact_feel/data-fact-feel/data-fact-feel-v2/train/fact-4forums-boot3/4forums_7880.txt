Why is that a good reason for this sort of law? What's the sense in removing the rights of citizens just to make a cop's job easier? Do you also support repealing the Fourth and Fifth Amendments (or the Canadian equivalent, if they have it), just to make cops' jobs easier? Allowing cops to use torture in interrogations would also make their jobs easier. Would you support that?
