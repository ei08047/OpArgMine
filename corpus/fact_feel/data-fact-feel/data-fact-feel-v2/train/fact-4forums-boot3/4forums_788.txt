When I shooting pin and jug shoots it was common to have a thousand each of .45ACP, .44SPL and .40 S&amp;W.  Let us not forget the 3 unannounced visits per year from the boyos of Waco. At what time do you think they would be visiting? Working hours so the chance exists of no one home? Or in the dark of night to catch one asleep. What sort of visit do you expect. A polite knock on the door and wait for an answer? Or perhaps a crashing down of the door with a no knock entry? Thanks but no thanks.
