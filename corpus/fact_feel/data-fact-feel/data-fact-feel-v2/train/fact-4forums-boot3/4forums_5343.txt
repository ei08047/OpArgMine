Don't insult Lee. He fought to protect his State's sovereignty. Slavery was not a major issue for him. He even led to the CS policy of enlisting blacks as condition for freedom.  I'm a Confederate reenactor, and it ###### me off when people don't respect the reasons we fought. It wasn't slavery. It wasn't racism.
