We agree that there certainly is a problem, correct?  Could it be video games, movies, or developmental issues, or??  Before we debate thoes topics, lets examine the same issue in the U.K.  Are video games in the UK? Yes.  Are violent movies in the UK? Yes.  Are there bad bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the UK? Yes.  Are handguns legal in the UK? NO  Does the UK have shooting rampages as often as the USA? NO  Are video games in the USA? Yes.  Are violent movies in the USA? Yes.  Are there bad parents / psychopaths / nuts in the USA? Yes.  Are hanguns legal in the USA? YES  Does the USA have shooting rampages more often then the UK? YES  It dosn't take a genius to find a correlation between handguns being legal and shooting rampages.  I agree that guns are not the problem in and of themselves, but humans are the problem; and humans wield guns.  Clearly, handguns should be illegal.
