Try this:  http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf  Go to Table 6, page 29, look in the first column of numbers (representing thousands of uninsured people) and scroll down to:  Nativity:  Not a citizen (includes legal aliens and known illegal aliens only...there's likely more)...9,396  (That's 9.396 million)  Income:  50k to 74,999.....7,826 (That's 7.826 milliion)  75K and up.....7,886 (That's 7.886 million)  While these don't match exactly the 10 and 17 million I claimed in the OP, they're close enough to get the point. Even if dropped to 9 and 15, it's still 24 million less than Hillary and Company claim...making their 47 million lose weight down to 23.
