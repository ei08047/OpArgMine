Actually it just took GOD a long time to work out the bugs in his ideas thats why humans only appeared very recently. We are special because he took his time to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to build his masterpieces - namely us. We are after all the crown of creation meant to dominate all the inferior life forms and to take whatever we wish from the planet. Are we not?
