According to data collected from each nation's embassy-  In 1996, handguns were used to murder 2 people in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada and 9,390 in the United States.   Would you rather have a lot of gun deaths or only a few? And tell me of a law that is 100% effective. There are traffic laws, but there are still car accidents. Does that mean we shouldn't have any traffic laws? No, not if those traffic laws lead to a reduction in car accidents which they do.  As for the second amendment and whether gun ownership is a right or a priviledge we can discuss later.
