When our representatives go against the Constitution, it is the role of the Supreme Court to correct this (when a case is brought up by someone else). And I would like to ask when the last time you were asked to vote for whatever you wanted. This is not a direct democracy, but a Representative Republic. When our representatives violate the Constitution, people can sue and it may make it to the highest court in the land.  By the way, I think state laws like this would be Constitutional, but federal law either way is unconstitutional.
