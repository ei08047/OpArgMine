Yes, that's true. If the majority places discriminations in place and the Court is bound to enforce the law as written, then the Court is bound to enforce that discrimination. That is democracy, and that is the rule of law. If we choose to undermine that democracy, which we have done, we have to be very careful where that leads. What we end up with is less and less of a representative democracy.  Who has the power at the end of it? Certainly not  the people .
