I may want to give a quick reminder that the bible was written by human beings, not a supernatural entity or Jesus. It is very unlikely that Jesus or God had anything to do with the bible, since the bible is not a very righteous, and preaches much hate. People who truely believe in doing good in the world and being followers of God would not even glance at this 2000 year old abomination.
