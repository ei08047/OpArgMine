fn 57 ammo that is sold in America is not Armour piercing. further more they make Armour piercing ammo for many many hand guns so pretty much any handgun given military ammo will pierce a vest. also any deer rifle will pierce a vest so are they going to ban those too? no, the gun is just being singled out i don't know why but it is.  also fn has sued any one calling there gun a cop killer.
