Why on earth would a woman come out now, admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago, when it was illegal, and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about?  Why on earth would any woman do that?  When did official medical records become non trustworthy? The conspiracy theories and blinders that both sides are wearing are astounding.  Waxy  P.S. I think the whole thing is repugnant, and any real politicizing of it by the Democrats would be disgusting IMHO. However, Bush did open the door with his strong anti-abortion stance, and sometimes, when you make your bed....
