I am not religious. However, I have spent some time studying religion, and your analysis is problematic. For a start, most early religions don't have an idea of heaven or even an afterlife (eg. early Judaism and Hinduism, both focused on success in this life).  Also, 2000 years ago many were aware the world was round.
