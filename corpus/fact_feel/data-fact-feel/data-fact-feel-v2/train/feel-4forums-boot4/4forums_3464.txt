I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.  Suppose this expedition had set out and hadn't found the transitional fossil. Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.
