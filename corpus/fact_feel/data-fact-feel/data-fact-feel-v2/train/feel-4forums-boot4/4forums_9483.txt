Yes but if you try to change it to something unrealistic it will not work and we end up with a lot of unwanted children who are very likely to grow up with serious problems.  I can?t think of anything sadder and more immoral then a policy that creates unwanted children as a side effect.  The religious are so worried about the period of time the child is basically not sentient and will make suffer those who are developed enough to actually be sentient all for the luxury of indulging their silly counter productive religious beliefs.
