That would bother me, if the law did anything but regulate the cosmetics of a weapon. And force me to change magazines every ten rounds.  P.S. WHen is building your product to comply with the law 'circumventing the law?' Should we ban SUV's because when laws were put on to increase fuel mileage, the car manufactures made them get better gas mileage?
