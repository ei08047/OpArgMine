While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a  second chance . I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance.  I probably shouldn't say  you  because it seems like you didn't have a choice in the matter.  Anyway, thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums.
