Yes, it would be a huge leap for law enforcement to jail someone for having a child. Not sure if it would send the messege the judge wanted or further polarized people.  I agree with what he was trying to do, but you're right that this is something that should not be enforced.  If this becomes a precedent, private lives are pretty much out the door. Might be a bit alarmist, but this makes me think that legislated sex is next.
