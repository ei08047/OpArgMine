No wonder we here in the U.S. are complaining about the stead flow of narcotics and drug gang violence flowing from the Mexican Violent Drug Cartel. No wonder we are complaining that the Mexican authorities have been complicit, and even corrupt, taking this illegal drug money and for allowing this problem to get this big and this bad.  Now the only way out of it is to blame me?
