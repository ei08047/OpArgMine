Your view of choice is your belief. I don't  believe  that a pregnant woman or anyone else should be able to choose for the child. That child does not have a choice. Choosing to kill someone is a choice, but it is not a choice that should be legal. Therefore, you are forcing your view of  choice  on me by making abortion (murder) illegal.
