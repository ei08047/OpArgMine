Well, assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed, then slavery certainly could be reintroduced. Minority freedoms are denied all the time. The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?  Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves. I really do not support rule by the very, very few.  Because this question is irrelevant.
