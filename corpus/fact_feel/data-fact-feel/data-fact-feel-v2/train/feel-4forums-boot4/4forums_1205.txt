I think even the Court knows that the Fourteenth was not well crafted, at least in terms of forsight. However, once it was ratified the Court really had no choice but to try to work it into the legal landscape.  Certainly State power needed to be curtailed to stop such institutions such as slavery, but I don't think restructuring how the entire Constitution works was the right move.
