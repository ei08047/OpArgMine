I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.  Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.  As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.  Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.  We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.
