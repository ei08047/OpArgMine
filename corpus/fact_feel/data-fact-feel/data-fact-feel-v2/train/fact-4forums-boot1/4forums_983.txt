I don't recall ever saying they were.  However, all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion. Elevated mutation rates were experienced by less than a fifth of the adapted bacteria. In addition, the rate in that subpopulation was elevated as a coincidental byproduct of gene duplication (a mutagenic promoter being co-located with the gene that conferred a reproductive advantage), and did not itself confer any benefit. The other 4/5ths of the bacteria which possessed duplicate lac- genes at the time of plating accumulated additional mutations at normal rates, including additional duplicate lac- genes at the same random-chance-per-division rate as they had prior to the selective environment being imposed. The rate of reversion to lac+ was also the same, on a per-gene basis, as in the absence of the selective environment; only the large numbers of lac- duplicates in the selected-for adaptive mutants made it more likely that one of them would revert.  In short, the organismic response you say makes the whole process intentional and systematic simply didn't happen, not here anyway. Neither the directed mutation, nor the subpopulation hypermutation hypotheses fit the facts.
