The one thing that annoys me the most is the ridiculous way they try to bring the zygote down to the level of a hair follicle.  Hello!?! A hair follicle is practically nothing but dead tissue besides the few cells that make up the base! It is nothing like a zygote, who is a living functioning being. They use this approach in their whole essay as if it made sense.  It made no sense at all, in fact, it made them look awfully stupid when I read it. I shudder to think how many people may be deceived by this thing if they don't realize this first. Did anybody else notice that?
