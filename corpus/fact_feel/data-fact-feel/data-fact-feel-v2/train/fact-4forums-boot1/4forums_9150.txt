Yes, yes, jyoshu is still struggling with this one?  1. Change the definition of a legal term, something that is done daily, to benefit a class of citizen currently discriminiated against legally and socially.  2. Don't change any legal definition, evar!  I suspect #1 helps the greatest number of people, and hurts no one.  #2 of course helps no one, and hurts gays.  Quite an easy moral choice if you ask me.  Of course, in jyoshu's dream-land,  voter  would still be defined as a white male. God bless the primitives.  -Mach
