Agreed. It does not matter whether abortion is included or not, it is unconstitutional for the federal government to be funding any of it. Of course, it is also unconstitutional for the federal government to be jumping in the middle of the abortion issue anyway since there is no possible way to read the constitution that would put abortion under the purview of the federal government. It is an issue for the states.  Woudn't things be simpler if we all just followed the constitution???
