Yea Close_slave_can honestly if you're looking for answers I would even go so far as to invest in Dr. Hovind's DvD collection, only like a $100, but it gives you the full side of the creationist perspective, there are 7 DvDs with like over 20 hours worth of studies and stuff.....I found it really interesting....that would be your best bet.....
