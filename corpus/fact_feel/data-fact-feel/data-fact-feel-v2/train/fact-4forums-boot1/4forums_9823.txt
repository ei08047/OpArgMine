Peppered moths simply emerged from the egg according to background...their  evolution  had nothing to do with random mutations or natural selection. Butterflies exhibit the same ability...they can emerge with specific wing variations/markings according to predators and other environmental influences. There is no selection.  http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot...yphenism1.html (see bottom picture)  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time  yea...no kidding.
