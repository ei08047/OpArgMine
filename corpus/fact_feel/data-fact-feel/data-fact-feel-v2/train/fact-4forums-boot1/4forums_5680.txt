The bible can hardly be argued as the infallible word of God, and if you think it is, then you are engaging in Circular Logic and believing in an unparsimonious being, which leaves you with 1 strike left as to why anyone should believe you.  Here comes the last pitch:  1. The Bible was written over and over and over by HUMANS many years post hoc, and it is applicable ONLY according to HUMAN interpretation, and the BIBLE is innaccurate on many occasions.  WOo hoo, game is won, by me.
