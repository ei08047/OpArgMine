I wasn't oversimplifying anything, only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun. But by disarming honest people as you would do, you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up. That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.  You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men. If you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here. It's just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here. But when all is said and done, dead is dead is dead.
