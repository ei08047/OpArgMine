And you're perfectly entitled to believe that, so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species, which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning, just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional. Just like all the other hominid fossils.  Are you starting to see my point yet? You're trying to claim that because Lucy isn't conclusive proof, she means nothing. That's fallacious reasoning: Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent.  I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.
