the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years. And what's so funny about it is I'm sure none of these articles make mention of this being a huge controversy and how it gives ammunition to creationsits: they just play like dissent doesn't exist.  How does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.
