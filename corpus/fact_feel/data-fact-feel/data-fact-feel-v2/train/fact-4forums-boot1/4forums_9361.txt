Well it gives us more indication as to the mode of life of Archaeopteryx as an early bird and more common structural features with small theropods that are suggested as the ancestral stock from which birds evolved. It is worth noting that both Velociraptor and Troodon lived a long time after Archaeopteryx; the suggestion here is all three had a common ancestor from which similar features were inherited.
