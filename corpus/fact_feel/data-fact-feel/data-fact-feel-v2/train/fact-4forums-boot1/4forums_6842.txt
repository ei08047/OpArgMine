Well, Barbarian is 1) a Christian, 2) a biologist, and 3) a teacher. I have known him on various boards for several years and I always marvel at his patience, as well as his knowledge. My impression is that he is knowledgeable and competent in each. (Can he figure out who I am?)  Sadly, I am not as patient as he. As has been pointed out to me on many occasions, I do not tolerate it well when ignorance is paraded as authority. For some reason, even when I mean no animosity, if I explain to a creationist why he/she is wrong, I am accused of being pedantic and dogmatic - even rude.
