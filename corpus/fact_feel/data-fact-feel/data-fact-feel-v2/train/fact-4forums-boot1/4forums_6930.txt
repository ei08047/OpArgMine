Well we all know that. But that's not what I'm saying. Here we've got the Brady Campaign telling Starbucks  We're appalled that you allow people to associate in such a free manner! Change it right now!  but they just don't seem to understand they're pushing something that has no legal standing.  This would be the equivalent of someone going up to the person behind the counter and saying they don't want to share the Starbucks coffee house with people who work blue collar jobs, and asking for them to be removed immediately.  Such ideas date back to the era of open racism and a lack of rights for black people. Simply because the policies are being enforced in a colorblind manner doesn't mean that it's not still racist or evil.
