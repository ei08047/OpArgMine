If something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then I would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website.  Maybe I should give a list of all the homosexuals in my community to a group of drunk rednecks...  this is as bad as the registered sex offender list.
