It doesn't seem to me that it is unconstitutional in nature if you are referring to the US constitution. It certainly doesn't violate the 8th amendment. To me the constitution question would be does the 1 gun per month violate the Massachusetts constitution's right to keep and bear arms. Now if there is a provision in the Massachusetts constitution against type of punishments than that changes the story.
