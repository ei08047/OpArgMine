This is what comes from trying to reason with people to whom the truth means nothing. Only proving their version of reality is what is important. They would rather cling to unprovable assumptions which are based in nothing more than man made outcomes derived from wishful thinking. They insist they have supplied us with proof that life first appeared on Earth 4.3 Billion Years ago and are offended when I don't accept their proof as reliable. My question is, how can any rational person really believe that what is theorized to have happened 4.3 billion years ago is so reliable as to be beyond questioning.  These people scoff and mock 5000 and even 2000 year old history from written records by educated people who are renowned in History for their record keeping accuracy while accepting these massive assumptions regarding what might have happened 4+ billion years ago on a dead Planet, if the Planet even existed at all back then. The irrationality of the so called intellectual of today boggles the mind.  And by the way, welcome to the forum.
