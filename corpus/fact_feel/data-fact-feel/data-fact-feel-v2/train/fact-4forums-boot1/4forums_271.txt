I am against abortions past the first trimester (3 months) and that stage there isn't enough brains to even feel pain..Not connections.  Past 20 weeks and I have real issues with the procedure. The time limit to an abortion is 24 weeks, I'd like to see that backed off by 4 weeks.  I am pro-choice, but pushing into that 24th week gets way to human like and gray mater matters. Naturally there are exceptions in my mind regarding health risks and such.
