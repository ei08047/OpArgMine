This isn't even remotely true. Two people can go to a church and marry without the permission of government, or not go to a church, they can go out in the woods and shout  I'm married . I don't know about you, but the government doesn't determine who I'm married too. What the government can do, subject to the will of the people, is decide which marriages it will recognize.  And upon what grounds do you base this claim? Government chooses not to recognize different types of marriages all the time, not just same sex marriages ie. polygamist marriages, relatives, age limits, etc. These recognitions are not only federal but vary state to state, for instance some states recognize 1st cousin marriages while others don't, as I recall, the age of consent to marry also differs among states.  While I agree that civil rights should not be up for vote, you have not given evidence that gov't recognition of marriage is a civil right.
