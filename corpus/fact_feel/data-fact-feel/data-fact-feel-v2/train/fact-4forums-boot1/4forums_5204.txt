And yet this is what they fossil record shows. There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.  Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a  fully developed  one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were  totally useless , is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions.
