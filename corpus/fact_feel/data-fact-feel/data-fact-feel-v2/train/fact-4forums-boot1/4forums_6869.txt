Your argument is akin to saying  We can't stop people over-dosing on heroin, so let's legalise it   Why have limitations on hand-grenades or mines? People use mines all over the world for bad. Obviously laws aren't going to work... but perhaps the laws are also suggestive of a particular ethos; a set of standards that the community believe are necessary for a civil society. Thus, a nation such as New Zealand, or Australia, promotes a more 'community-minded' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded' citizen. This also carries over into general attitudes towards one's neighbours. In America, you're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics, or commies or someone. Even the government's out to rip away your rights. This 'seige' mentality permeates American society.  For the interest of those who aren't aware, gun ownership for self-protection (from nasty criminals) is not protected by the Constitution ... it is written to state that a well-armed militia is necessary for the protection of rights.
