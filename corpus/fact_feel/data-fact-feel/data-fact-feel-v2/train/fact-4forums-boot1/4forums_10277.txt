Here speaks the voice of reason, who embraces the pathetic theory of creation, that utterly ridiculous group which passes itself off as a viable alternative to real science, whose outbursts demonstrate woeful ignorance of the world around us and scientific endeavour.  These are the ramblings of an individial with neither the wit nor wisdom to see beyond his own preconceived ideas, an inability to put aside bias, and one who plainly denies the power of the intellect in arriving at a balanced world-view.
