I think you should teach everything about pregnancy and sex. The problem comes in when no one takes your seriously. Abortion allows for a no consequence view on sex. It's like teaching the dangers of steroids in baseball yet the consequence is to take a 1 day class on substantive abuse if you get caught. Of course the rewards are much better. Same thing with attitude towards sex. If you have that fail-safe than the consequences really aren't too bad so preventing pregnancies becomes harder.
