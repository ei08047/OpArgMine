Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of  creation science  and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.  But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.
