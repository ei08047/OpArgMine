Well, sure there are, and to say that laws based on the Bible don't exist is to deny reality. You might be surprised to know that around 3/4s of our states have blue laws on their books(http://college.hmco.com/history/read...0_bluelaws.htm), some in  liberal  New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut). They're probably not ever enforced, but they're there.  At one time laws against blaspheming were common. There were laws against swearing in public. Lots of things. Religion and the Bible has long had a profound effect on law in this country.
