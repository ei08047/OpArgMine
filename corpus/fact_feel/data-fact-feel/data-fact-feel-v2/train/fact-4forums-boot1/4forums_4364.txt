The great majority of abortions happen in the first trimester (over 80%) so you would only be stopping a fairly small percentage of abortions that way. I personally see a reason for putting restrictions on third trimester abortions (since a mind might exist in the fetus) but haven't heard any good arguements yet about second trimester restrictions. What would your reasons be for restricting second trimester abortions?  FYI: In most of Europe, that is how abortion laws stand - available in the first trimester but largely restricted in the second and third, except for certain exceptions. In the UK, it is only third trimester abortions that are restricted. Where US polls are concerned, it seems that they also would agree with you - over 80% of Americans would restrict third trimester abortions, about 2/3rds would restrict second trimester abortions, and about 2/3rds would keep first trimester abortions generally legal (this from a 2003 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll one can find at pollingreport.com).
