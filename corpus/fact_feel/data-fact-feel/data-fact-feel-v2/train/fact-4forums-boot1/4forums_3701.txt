Hm, that does not seem to match the reading of Steven's dissent. He seems pretty set against incorporation.  [T]he right to possess a firearm of one&#8217;s choosingis different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term &#8220;liberty&#8221; encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms  and  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners&#8217; asserted right, there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case. The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one&#8217;s choosing&#8212;a handgun, for petitioners&#8212;is one that is &#8220;comprised within theterm liberty&#8221; in the Fourteenth Amendment  The practical impact of various gun-control measures may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive threat to the social order&#8212;and that reasonable restrictions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable burden on one&#8217;s personal liberty&#8212;is as old as the Republic. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a foundational premise of modern government that the State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence
