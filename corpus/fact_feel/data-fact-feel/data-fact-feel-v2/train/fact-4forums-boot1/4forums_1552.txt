Its not isolated! Its part of a pattern!   You can check the Violence Policy Center's Concealed Carry Killers website to see the most recent killings by concealed handgun permit holders (151 since May 2007, including nine dead law enforcement officers).   And thats only the people killed! Its only the tip of the iceberg! What about all the innocent people injured and threatened by these crazy gunslingers? What about all the abuses the NRA covers up?
