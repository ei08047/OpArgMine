I do not believe it. The sources cited by the pro-freedom movement are footnoted INDEPENDENT studies..  Your link states: An analysis conducted by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence   This was biased and faked at best.... Show me..... DC Survey says! XXX Show me.... Baltimore!!!, Survey says! XXX!  They don't give links to thier data (pro-freedom sites do), They don't even break it down by state!  This whole campaign is based on an emotional response of Brady's wife... Show me... independent study! Survey says! XXX!
