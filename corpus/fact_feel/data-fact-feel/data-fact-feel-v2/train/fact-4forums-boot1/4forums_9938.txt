Of course not. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause. You see, no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination. Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds. It seems a reasonable hypothesis but Majerus had several quibbles with Kettlewell's methodology even though he believes the hypothesis to be correct.
