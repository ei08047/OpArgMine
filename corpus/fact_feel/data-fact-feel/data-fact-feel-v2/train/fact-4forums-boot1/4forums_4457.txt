Just a newly-evolved structure. It happens.  That's always a shock to newbies. If you think that's all there is to it, you must be homozygous for the gullibility allele.  It's true. You don't have a  nose gene  for example. Rather your nose is the result of a number of different genes, the physical forces that shape all organisms, and perhaps other things like nutrition.  This was very well examined about 100 years ago by D'Arcy Thompson, in On Growth and Form. More recently, some of this was examined by Stephen Vogel in Life's Devices. Worth learning about.  There's a lot more to this than you imagine.  Barbarian observes:  ...In fact, as the article pointed out, the particular group of lizards to which this new population belongs, does not have cecal valves.  .  Getting bigger is hardly the same thing as evolving a new structure. But there isn't a  tall gene  that works in exclusion to everything else, either.  Random mutation and natural selection. It works very well, as you see.  Just common sense. If a mutation provides some benefit, it tends to be retained. Over time, (sometimes over a very short time) this can produce a new structure as we see in this case.
