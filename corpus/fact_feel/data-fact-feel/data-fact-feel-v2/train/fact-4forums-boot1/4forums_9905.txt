You are correct. Fighting crime has never been the idea behind registration. Its more like some left-tard politico urinating on your leg and telling you its raining.  Well so far the courts have gone with protecting the felons. I don't believe the biased left mainstream media will be covering it in a favorable light either. Our only hope is the blogsphere and talk radio. But the left is after them in a big way. They can't bring back the  fairness doctrine  so now its the magic word diversity. As in diversity of ownership. When are we the people going to kick that garbage to the curb? What ever happened to equal protection under that law. Now its conservatives need not apply.
