Well that was a lovely story and cudos on working in the anti-war angle.  No, the 50 or more GIANT posters in a row alongside a public (taxpayer funded) roadway do not affect me personaly in any way from a shock perspective. As I said, I am strongly against abortion, I have seen the same pictures many times before.  My complaint is the virtual forcing of all citizens to view the photos as they drive down a public roadway, and the harrassing of motorists at stop lights.  Mainly my point in posting this thread was to try to find out if this was a common type of anti-abortion protest in other parts of the country. I'm quite sure many other  conservatives  will view this type of protest as a wonderful thing. I think it actually works against the anti-abortion movement and alienates potential supporters.
