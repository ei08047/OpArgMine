I agree with Barbarian. In my short experience on these message boards (less than a year), in a zealotry contest the creationists tend to win this one hands down! Look at the examples of those who insist that there is a world-wide conspiracy in the scientific community to suppress the truth!  But I should say that this is on an individual basis. There have been creationists that, although they insist that they know the  truth', can maintain a pleasant and interesting conversation.  And, sadly, Close_slave_can is also right in that there are too many people on the evolution side who are a little too quick to attack creationists when they start to argue. This is understandable, of course, since many creationists are repeating the same bad arguments that we have all heard a bazillion times, and we have just recently had an example of someone who would not listen to reason since  all scientists are biased and cover up contrary evidence  -- it is very easy to stereotype anyone who comes along and states something that sounds pro-creation. I am afraid that I have done that myself.
