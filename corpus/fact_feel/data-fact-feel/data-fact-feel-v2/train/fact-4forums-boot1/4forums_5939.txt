Evolution = changes with in a living organism. As explained on other threads. It does work off and stem from other origin studies. Secular biogenisis is filled with evolutionary tales. Cosmology uses these changes to qualify there theories.  Evolution has everything to do with morality. If evolution as it is currently held is true than man has no moral responsiblity to another man. We are only living organisms in a line of changes. No goal no origin, only meaningless existence. Therefore no law should ever be passed. Why would one ape in the jungle rule another ape. While territorial they are not governing.
