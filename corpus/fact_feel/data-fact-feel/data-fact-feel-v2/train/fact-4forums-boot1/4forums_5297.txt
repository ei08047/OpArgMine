I was actually there with PZ and Dawkins. It was pretty scary at first. Dawkins came in with me and the gf, but the associate producer, Mark Mathis, spotted PZ and ordered him removed. I was shaking and sweating when we sat down, and the film just made me angrier. On the other hand, PZ simply went downstairs to the Apple store in the mall and wrote up a blog post. Right now, reporters from national newspapers keep calling our hotel room.  It was pretty awesome at the end of the film during the Q&amp;A when Dawkins stood up and asked,  Why did you EXPEL Dr. PZ Myers when he was featured in your film, thanked in the credits for his participation, and paid for the interview?   My take: Mathis lied a lot.
