**  You can 'describe' materialism in ways that are untrue, but that won't make change the reality of the case. What materialism has done, under a long series of name changes, [the last being 'naturalism', if I'm not mistaken], has been to desperately rationalize the evidence of actual reality in the form of 'forces' and other phenomena antithetical to its principles and assumptions by pretending that what it says isn't what it means. For example that its denial of all things immaterial and incorporeal and insubstantial doesn't apply to forces, mass, energy, and so on. All very darwinian SOP.
