Just about any phrase you want can come up with a bible code, right? Is there a program out there than looks for specific phrases with gaps ??  It should be possible to use the bible codes to prove that Intelligent Design is a fake, right .. some phrase like.  Intelligent design is fraud  and  William Demski is a con artist , or something similar. That would be amusing.
