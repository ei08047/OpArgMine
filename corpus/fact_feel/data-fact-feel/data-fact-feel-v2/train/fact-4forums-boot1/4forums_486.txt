From the data we have seen regarding crime trends in britian since the gun ban, the ONLY people who have benifited from that particular bit of legislation are the criminals.  Crime in britain has been on a steady rise since the ban was passed. They are even considering arming their police officers now. It seems logical that reversing that particular bit of ill concieved legislation would benifit ONLY law abiding citizens. THe criminals apparently have not obeyed the ban, they simpley get their weapons through other outlets. Recently they have started convrting starting pistols. In America, a converted startign pistol would be a pretty poor choice for a weapon, there is good chance you would be laughed at. Apparently in Britain, people are being terroriz4d by them/
