Yes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion.
