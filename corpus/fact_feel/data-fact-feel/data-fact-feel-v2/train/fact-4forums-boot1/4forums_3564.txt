Walking-fish:  I basically agree with you. I guess I was being redundant in this regard. I was thinking out loud, in cyberspace. But it is interesting that we humans may be the first species to actually go beyond the need for this death &amp; reproduction cycle by genetically or artificially reinventing ourselves. But now I'm thinking out loud again on the web.
