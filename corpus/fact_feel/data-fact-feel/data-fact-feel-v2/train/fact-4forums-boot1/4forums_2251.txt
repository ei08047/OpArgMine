The US has a very high homicide rate compared to other developed nations. They also have a lot of guns. What studies are you talking about?  I think your theory too simple. Guns make it easier to kill people. Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun?   From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm  Some facts you may find interesting:   Crime in England and Wales remains stable and the chances of being a victim of crime are still the lowest in more than twenty years, according to the first quarterly crime update published today by the Home Office.....  British Crime Survey trends since 1997 indicate:  All crime down 27 per cent  Burglary down 39 per cent  Vehicle thefts down 32 per cent  Violence crime down 26 per cent   http://www.policesupers.com/scripts/...SP?news_id=314
