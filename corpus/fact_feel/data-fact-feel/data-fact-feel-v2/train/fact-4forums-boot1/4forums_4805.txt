Weird, str8 atheists have been civilly marrying for eons without special stipulations - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor  Meh....  I personally think  religious protection  is much adieu over nothing, as the EXISTING first amendment adequately protects. With interracial marriage, we didn't have churches  forced  to perform interracial marriages they didn't want to perform.  The same would be true of gay marriage, and I have yet to see a U.S. example disproving the protection of a church from not having to perform the gay marriage, and/or not having to allow it within their private church.  But whatever...  The legislature can easily make these changes, if the governor is accurate in saying that is all the changes amount to.  New Hampshire could soon be state #6...
