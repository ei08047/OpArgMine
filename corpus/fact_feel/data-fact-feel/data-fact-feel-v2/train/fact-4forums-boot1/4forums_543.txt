So, if one person says that  Neo-darwinism  is dead, and many people say that it is quite well supported by the evidence and show said evidence, we are supposed to believe the one?  By the way, I notice that they failed to provide the context for the statement,  The 'modern synthesis' is dead.  Sound like a quote mine to you?  Oh, wait: are you saying that it is gaurenteed to be true because it contradicts the ToE?
