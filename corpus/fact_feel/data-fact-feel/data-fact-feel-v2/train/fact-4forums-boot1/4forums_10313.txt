Oh, any of the bases can degrade. Guanine is just the most reactive.  Some guy down the hall works on nothing but guanine adducts on oligonucleotides. The type of DNA lesion is also determined by the sequence right around the guanine, so there are sequence-specific lesions and adducts.  I think once people realize that DNA is very easily mutated and that the cellular machinery needed to repair it is pretty complex and imperfect, then they will see that mutations happen all the time and there are so many that some of them will just turn out to be  beneficial  or at least not detrimental.  Here's an example of 8-oxo-guanine actually inhibiting the DNA repair process.  http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/24/21300
