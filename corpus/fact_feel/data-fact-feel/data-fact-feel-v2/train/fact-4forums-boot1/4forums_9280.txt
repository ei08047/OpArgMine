WOW it comes down to this; heterosexuals are given a privledge just because of who they are and who they love. Gay people are denied equal treatment to heterosexuals because of who they are and who they love. The way I understand this is that segregation deined blacks equal treatment to whites because of who they where. You would not deny that the latter is a civil rights issue but you can not bring yourself to see the former is also. Why is that? So what you are saying is that it is ok to discriminate based upon sexual orientation but not race or religion? Why?  When heterosexuality and homosexuality are treated equally and both are considered normal and acceptable then I will move on. There is nothing wrong with being gay, it is not a sin, and it is not immoral. Until being gay is considered equal to being a hetero then you will just have to continue being sick of hearing about it. I am sick of hearing evil funamenalists insult my family because of who we are. I am sick of being denied marriage because of someone elses privledge, and religious beliefs.  Btw this is also the definition of marriage from this site http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage
