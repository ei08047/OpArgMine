I started reading the article and discovered the old 'bait and switch' con job.  They give the notion that they may find some 'fast evolving coding of genes' in the gamete reproduction. Big build-up in that area of thought. So was there any fast evolving genes discovered or was it more of the same ol' fantasy?  Then when I closed the window with the website, it closed all my other windows as well. So I won't be going back to review it unless I have nothing else going on.
