TF Green was a small little airport when I moved here 10years ago. It is now 10 times that size with multiple terminals and dozens of airlines. Yes, it has changed. It would be fun! My friends are trying to talk me into a UUC minister. Since we don't really have anyone to officiate the ceremony, I am guessing that is the ruote we will need to take.  We did decide today to axe the cake thing....too hetero for me.  We decided it really will be at my boss's house.....yeah!  We picked a date in September......woo woo.  I will update you all as we plan!
