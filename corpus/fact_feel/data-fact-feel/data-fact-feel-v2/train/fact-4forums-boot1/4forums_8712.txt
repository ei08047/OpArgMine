Let's hear more. Remember; it is estimated that over 6 billion people were on earth at the time of the flood.  Also, Genesis 1 : 6 thru 1 : 10 - Water was above and below the firmament of Heaven. What happened to the waters that were above the firmament? Was this used for the deluge that covered the earth?  It had never rained before The Flood. Why, if someone made up this story, would they have said such a thing? Wouldn't it be much more believeable if they would have said,  There had never been such a rain as this... ?
