Well, there you go. The fact he, in his reverse analogy, portrays mere disagreement in many cases as telling  posters there how disgusting and sinful they are and how their rights should be denied  only makes my point. No once do I recall seeing anyone here saying that he or anyone else was  disgusting,  and  sinful.  Apparently he's not too familiar with the concept of ad hominem either.
