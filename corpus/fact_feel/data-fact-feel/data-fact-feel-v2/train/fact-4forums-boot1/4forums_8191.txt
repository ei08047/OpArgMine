Good.  The moment someone starts  believing  in evolution is the moment they cease following the scientific path.  Evolution does not require belief at all- it requires an appraisal of available information and a logical analysis of how well the theory fits the evidence. If that theory is sound (as our example here is) then we can accept it as being a sound description of the evidence we have.
