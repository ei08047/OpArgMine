How are we now able to observe the orbit of Pluto, when the orbit of Pluto supposely takes 249 years? It was only discovered in 1930. According to your logic, any claims that Pluto orbits the sun is pure speculation and will be until 2179.  By the way, we observe evolution all the time. You see, the threory of evolution has to do with how living organisms change through time, not with how the world came about. We have observed the bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics all the time. It is becoming a real problem in that there are some bacteria that are immune to almost every antibiotic we have.
