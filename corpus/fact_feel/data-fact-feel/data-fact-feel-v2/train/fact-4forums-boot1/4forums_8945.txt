Indeed he is. Good analysis there. The question of whether N was our ancestor or just a cousin has long been under study. At times as you point out it was thought to be ancestral at others not. At no time was any of this seen to have an impact on evolutionary theory as such, nor was there any reason for it to do so. Its a question of the evolution of a specific species (ie ourselves and N) and not a question of evolutionary theory.  As to modern Ns consider that they seem to have established themselves as spokesmen for a well known insurance company in modern times. They are quite intelligent and fast on their feet, but they seem never to have invented grooming. Its probably genetic. I also have observed what appear at first glance to be hybrids on a bus I used to take to work.
