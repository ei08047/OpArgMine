Abortion on demand is more accurate then abortion on request?request makes it sound so flimsy as if women need to sit in a waiting room and pleasantly request for it by some authority figure. Abortion on demand is by far more accurate because such a service is vital; not a ?convienence.? Abortion is an crucial sacrament within the fabric of American society; 1 in 4 women will have them but everyone is afraid to admit how much we depend on it. Abortion has always been popular whether it was in the 1700s or 2000s, whether criminal or legal and whether you were against it or not. Americans demand for abortion, not request it. Were black American slaves requesting or demanding freedom?  People who think abortion is a convenience are out of touch with reality and are deeply in denial.
