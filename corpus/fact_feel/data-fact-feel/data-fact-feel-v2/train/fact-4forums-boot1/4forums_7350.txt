So you honestly believe that with the technology available at the time, Noah constructed a monstrous synthetic habitat large enough to hold two of every creature on earth? Complete with enough aquatic capacity to hold two of every ocean creature, including whales and sharks? With enough travel speed to cover the entire globe in time to pick up two of every animal, from the burrowing frogs of the african desert to the Polar bears of Antarctica?  And that this vessel was also large enough to carry a supply of food adequate for so many hundreds of millions of animals? And that the waste disposal systems were adequate to handle such a volume of waste?  I'm sorry, but anyone with even a shred of credibility must take the story of Noah and his ark as nothing more than an interpretation and adaption of an ages old story. To interpret it as the literal truth is beyond belief.
