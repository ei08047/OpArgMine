What liberals?  http://www.republicansforchoice.com/  Last time I checked abortion wasn't a clear cut partisan issue.  By the way you implied it, you act like it is either expected or common for conservatives to be intolerant racists, homophobes or sexists.  Oh well, thanks for playing the knee-jerk, partisan card for us. It is always a crowd pleaser. Next you can tell us about how liberals have a big laser cannon on the moon that is being used to vaporize decency and morality in America and how they'll force 4 year old children into watching Brokeback Mountain at public schools from their secret base.  Those dastardly liberals!
