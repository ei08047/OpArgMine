Well not exactly, but it does come down to  biblical creationism  without the courage to admit that it is a son of  biblical creationism . At least the biblical creationists (YEC and OECs) were sufficiently honest to identify their candidate for the creator/designer. IDers cannot seem to recall who the designer might be - they like most laywers take the fifth amendment.
