look at it this way: the creation vs evolution forum is neither a science nor religious forum. science has a distinct forum, and so does religion. the issue of creation vs evolution is where the 2 interests bump heads, and the result og this overlap is massive enough to warrant a distinct discussion forum of its own.  there are a vast variety of other religious issues other than the genesis account, just as there is a lot more to science than evolutionary biology, paleontology and anthropology. likewise, there are many religious people, even christians, that have no interest in creation, as there are many scientists that do not entertain evolution topics, but neglecting either does not make them less of a christian or scientist respectively, in their views.  this forum specifically focuses on the debates between the area where these different ideas intersect. as such you cant separate the two.
