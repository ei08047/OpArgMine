My GOD! anti gay or not, where's common decency?? My heart breaks for that poor family. I hope that hospital has to pay through the nose for what it did to those poor children, denying them the opportunity to see their dying parent. I really don't care what the politics are in that poor, backward state. there is simply no excuse for treating childen like that. Also, this is a hospital, and there was an accurate medical history available to them they did not avail themselves of. This is gross negligence!
