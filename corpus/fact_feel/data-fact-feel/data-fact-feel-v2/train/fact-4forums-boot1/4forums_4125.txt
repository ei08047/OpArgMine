A lot of people have taken issue with  the woman's health  phrase as a caveat due to the fact it is so vague. I tend to think it is too vague to be reasonable. If specific standards were put in place as to determine at what point such a phrase is violated, then I might be more open to it. Because  health of the mother  could be so wide-open to interpretation, it would be an allowance for abortion that would basically have no meaning and significance. And that is, I think, one reason the pro-choice lobby wanted such phraseology.  Yeah, I certainly think it's a good ruling. IMO there is no reason (other than the life of the mother) to do such a horrible thing to a late-term fetus.
