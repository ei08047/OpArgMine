I think I understand this.  The goal is clear, check.  Self-restraint is good, check.  But I do not see what this has to do with the OP. Could you explain, please?  Who are you recommending should use self-restraint?  The protestors?  Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control?
