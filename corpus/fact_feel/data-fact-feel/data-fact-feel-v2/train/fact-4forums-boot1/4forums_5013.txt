I know of no one that wants to make women a second class cititzen.......I know I sure don't............I just want and infant in the womb to have the same chance at life that you and I had.........  It is my hope that before I die that I see the barbaric act of legaling killing babies in the womb, Rowe V Wade overturned and give the decision on abortion back to individual state so that all these beautiful babies. gifts from God hve a chance at life...........
