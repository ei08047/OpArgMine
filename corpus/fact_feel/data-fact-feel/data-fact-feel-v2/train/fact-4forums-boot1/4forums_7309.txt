Sure I agree with it. The thing is, you used to argue (not in these exact words of course) that decency on the part of the hospital wasn't required, all that gays needed to do was visit a lawyer and they'd be all set. I am asking you to clarify that position now to see if you still hold that opinion or if you've changed it, specificially in light of this event. Simple question, no gotcha waiting to pounce.
