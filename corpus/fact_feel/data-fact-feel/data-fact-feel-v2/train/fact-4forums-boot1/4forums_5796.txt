It is a widely known fact. A simple search on Google will turn up hundreds of articles, reports and so on.  Dr Michael Ackermann has a great deal of specific information (although he is Canadian, he research applies to the U.S. too)  http://www.dsgl.org/Articles/Ackermann.htm  He has a complete list of references and links to other sources on that page. A good one is here:  teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/Suter/med-lit.html  No. The point is that doctors are more dangerous than guns, highlighting the stupidity of the anti-gun crowed who believe that guns should be outlawed because they are &#8220;dangerous.&#8221;  Furthermore, if we wanted to include deliberate killing, we would have to include doctors who deliberately kill. And we would have to point out that many people who are killed with guns - should be killed (violent criminals, for example).  A few other education links are here:  http://www.aapsonline.org/press/medsentgun.htm  http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/...n/doctors.html  Yes. But guns are about more than safety.  A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.
