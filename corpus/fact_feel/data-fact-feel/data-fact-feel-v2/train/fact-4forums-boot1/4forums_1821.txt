This is why arguments like  well, our population is out of control  never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying  Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!  I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better.
