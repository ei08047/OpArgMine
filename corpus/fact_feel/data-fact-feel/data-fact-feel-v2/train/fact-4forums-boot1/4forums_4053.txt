Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.
