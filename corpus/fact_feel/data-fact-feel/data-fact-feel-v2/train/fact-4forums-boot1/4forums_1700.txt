Speaking of antibody diversification:  Evolution In Action: Our Antibodies Take 'Evolutionary Leaps' To Fight Microbes  Wonder what the reaction would be if the title was:  Teleological Evolution in Action: Our Antibodies Take 'Evolutionary Leaps' to fight Microbes  Why Teleological evolution? Well, the immune system purposefully manipulates information by using the optimality of the genetic code, random variation and selection as a means to an end? antibody diversification. (See how)  Teleological evolution is not limited to the immune system.  Somatic evolution of malignancy alse seem to have a teleological streak  Adaptive landscapes and emergent phenotypes: why do cancers have high glycolysis?  Somatic evolution of malignancy:  The purposeful manipulating of information by using the optimality of the genetic code, random variation and selection as a means to an end? adaptation to hypoxic and acidic fitness landscapes.  Viewing cells as computers that make other computers and information as an irreducible property of nature makes this view tenable.
