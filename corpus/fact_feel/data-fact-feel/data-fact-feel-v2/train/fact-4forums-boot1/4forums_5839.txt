Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this:  My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject .  Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it.
