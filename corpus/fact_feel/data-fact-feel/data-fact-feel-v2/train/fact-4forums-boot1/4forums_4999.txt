Advocate of  choice?  What is  choice?  As I have stated many times on these threads,  Choice without reference to the object of choice is morally empty.  Abe Lincoln (paraphrased).  But do you not tell that child of rape that her worth hinges on how she came about? Do you not tell her that you would have consented to her existence being wiped out at any time? Do you not imply that anyone is in peril if we begin to assess their nature of creation, their standing in life, their physical characteristics, etc.?  I was not aware of that.
