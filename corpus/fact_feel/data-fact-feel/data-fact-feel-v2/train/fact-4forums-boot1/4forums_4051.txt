Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are  better suited  than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?
