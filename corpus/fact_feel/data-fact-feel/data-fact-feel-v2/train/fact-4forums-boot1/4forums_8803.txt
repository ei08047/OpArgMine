If Obama gets elected he will walk straight into the worse financial crisis in the states for decades. Within weeks Russia,North Korea and Iran will test his resolve( China will wait to see what he does). This will keep him busy for a while. The last thing that he will want to do will be to address controversial issues like gun control or abortion. This will come in his second term or never!
