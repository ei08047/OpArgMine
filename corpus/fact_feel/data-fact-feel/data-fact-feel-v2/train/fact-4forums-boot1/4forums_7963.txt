The report is very recent. Lack of action by the ATF within a few days of a report being released is not evidence of anything. Secondly, the ATF can't just walk into a gun show and randomly choose people to investigate. They have to have specific information about the identity of people suspected of breaking the law at gun shows before investigating. So unless they are given such information about the sellers in the NYC report they can't do anything.
