I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.
