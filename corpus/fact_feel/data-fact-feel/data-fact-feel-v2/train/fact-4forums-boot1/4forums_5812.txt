A broken-down tv set is not a valid parallel. It doesn't reproduce, and there is only one of it. Life, on the other hand, does reproduce (at least some organisms do).  It would be interesting for someone to make a counter displaying the number of times natural selection needs to be explained to creationists.  Actually, that would be easy: infinity. They just don't get it.
