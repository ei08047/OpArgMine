My fault for being too broad. The existence of a creator cannot be proven or disproven, and literal interpretation of the Bible can be disproven by science.  That is one of my hangups w/the Bible. The '7 days thing', how basically everything has existed thousands, not millions of years. It is rather inconceivable that God (or any god) created everything in 7 'human' days, and has sat around since then, pretty much status quo. And all the billion yr old objects discovered are just incorrect science.
