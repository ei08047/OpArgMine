Well that's just like a good darwinist to make a ridiculous challenge. What I can show, however, is that thoughts, emotions and social settings can re-express genes, which can lead not only to a change in phenotype, but also to new, heritable traits passed down to future generations. You guys' hypothesis that it takes a new or changed gene for  evolution  (ie..change in population over time) to take place is unsupported, unscientific, un-proven -- and ultimately wrong.
