A radio telescope can see wavelengths that we can't, and then electronically map those wavelengths to colors we can see. Here's an example:  http://science.hq.nasa.gov/skyspy/ht...sn1604rad.html  Or, on the other end of the spectrum, you could use an x ray telescope, again mapping the wavelengths we can't see to those that we can:  http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/so...solar_014.html  Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at.  If we can't see the wavelengths that something is giving off, then we can't see it. Every object around you right now is giving off infrared light, but even if the room were pitch dark you wouldn't be able to see the glow because our eyes don't pick up that wavelength. It would just look dark.  Mistakes are always possible, but not due to what you seem to be concerned about. For the sort of science you seem to be refering to we don't use naked eye observations. We use machines designed to pick up the appropriate wavelengths of light. We know the limitations of the eye, and so built tools that can do things the eye can't.
