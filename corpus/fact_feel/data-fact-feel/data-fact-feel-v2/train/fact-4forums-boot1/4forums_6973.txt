I think that's overly simplistic. I've spoken with alot of creationists, both in forums and in real life, and many of them are quite intelligent and well educated. The problem is that people have an amazing ability to filter out things that don't fit into their pre-conceived notions. I'm sure you've seen this in all sorts of different fields, it's just most pronounced when someone is denying facts, rather than refuting an opinion. If someone is devoutly religious, and firmly believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible, then facts which contradict that belief simply don't take hold. It's not that they don't understand logic or science. It's more like they've trained themselves to not hear things which go against their beliefs.
