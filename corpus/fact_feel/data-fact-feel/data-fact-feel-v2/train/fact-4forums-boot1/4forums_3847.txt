How many discoveries in modern biology that now saves lives were discovered as a result of bible study?  Take your pick, do you want to die young and religious or embrace science and die at a ripe old age?  The religious all live and rely on things that only science could provide while constantly arguing angst it.  Personally I think the religious that do that should be restricted to receive only 17th century medicine so we can remove the blockage to progress they present.
