I'll admit, it would be nice if life on our world was benevolent enough to not attack the weak. But the problem is, it's not. The gun laws in the US are diverse, and this is encouragement to criminals. It makes it easy for a criminal to obtain a handgun in Pennsylvania, for example, and take it up to New York for an unfair advantage over the weak. Life isn't sunshine and rainbows. Get used to it.
