This single sentence takes the whole train off the tracks into a huge train wreck of logic. This implies that the probability of a mutation should be calculated after the fact because evolution is progress along some specified path towards a goal. What a foolish, foolish assertion. Why is a single  perfect  mutation required as opposed to one of millions that take place in a population at every generation that may offer a slight reproductive advantage? As Gould often asked, do  historical patterns of development represent a set of mechanically limited and excellent, perhaps even optimal, designs,  or  do they represent just one possible solution among numerous entirely plausible alternatives of strikingly different form, each yielding a subsequent history of life entirely different from the outcome actually experienced on earth?  (Gould, Stephen Jay. 2002. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. p. 1159) Thus, the likelihood of a mutation is not determined because subsequent evolution would have been impossible without it. The mutation preceded the path of evolution. There was no goal towards which evolution was aimed.  Ted Dace (not a scientist), Bertvan, and ww all seem to have evolutionary theory backasswards.
