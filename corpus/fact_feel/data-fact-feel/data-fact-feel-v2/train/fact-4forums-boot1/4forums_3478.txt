No worries mate. Brooklyn&#39;s 81st Precinct probed by NYPD for fudging stats; felonies allegedly marked as misdemeanors  New York cops 'fudge' stats like the Tories to make their  strict gun laws  look more compatible to the States that do not have draconian anti gun laws and need not depend on the cops protecting you when they have no duty to do so.  I have been following UK stats for a long time and no matter who is in power, the crime rates increase. Often the perp is set free and the victem is the one punished like the incident you mentioned: Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law.  Gun control is not crime control! It is just more evident in the UK. At least here you can still shoot the _____________s and that is a great deterrant
