Nothing you've ever said regarding classical evolutionary theory has ever '######' me off, because in every case you have demonstrated contempt-fuelled ignorance of what it actually states. The number of incorrect statements you've made about what 'darwinists think' or 'darwinists believe' or, quite recently, what darwinists' materialist ideology 'forces them to assert' is large and increases daily. And so long as you continue to batter your pet strawman of the ToE in preference to tackling the real deal, I won't have to 'defend' anything; I'll just have to keep on correcting the same old mistakes.
