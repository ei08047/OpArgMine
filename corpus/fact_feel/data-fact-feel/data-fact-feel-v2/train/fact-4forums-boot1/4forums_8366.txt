Well, I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there, so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way. The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.
