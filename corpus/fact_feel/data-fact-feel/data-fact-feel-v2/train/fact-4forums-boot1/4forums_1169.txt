Some civil unions do not grant all the rights of marriage. However, if we assume they do, then the only differences are the name, the meaning society associates with the name (that is, society is more likely to give the morality behind same-sex relationships equal consideration if they are treated equally under the law), and the fact that they are different institutions under the law. The fact that they are different institutions would allow a future law to be passed applying to one but not the other. This could also present the following problem: let's say a governor recieves a bill passed by the legislature which grants benefits to both civil unions and marriage. The governor could line-item veto the benefits to civil unions, making those benefits only for marriage.
