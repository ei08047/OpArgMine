Well, there are some groups that say only some gun control, but they have a hidden agenda. The Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center, both favor complete prohibition of guns, even though they do not advocate it openly. Yes I believe in some gun control, but only that which is logical. If you make it illegal, it will just create a big black market, and we all know how that is. LA in California has a big black market thanks to gun control, still politicians here keep advocating more of the  useless  gun control. XXXXXX..
