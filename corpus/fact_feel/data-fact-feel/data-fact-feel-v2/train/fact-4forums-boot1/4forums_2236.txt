Did ya ever notice that the people who do the work which you always point out as being adverse to a particular scientific area are always people who are well trained in that area? Don't you see something of a contradiction in the idea that physicists would conduct work which cause physics to crash and burn??? And of course in this instance there is no crash and burn just an interesting new finding - which has yet to be confirmed.
