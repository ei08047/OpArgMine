Wrong. There are a number of views on genesis.  1) Genesis is a literal story  2) Genesis is false as a literal story  3) Genesis is a metaphorical story to explain the origin of the world to people without a understand of the world much less science.  4) Genesis is merely a story that provides the setting for the morals and values of Christanity.  personally 3 makes the most sense to me.  Trying to explain astrophysics, evolution and general science to ignorant, nomadic israelites is quite retarded. If I was trying to do it, I'd have a similar form of genesis as well.  Plus you're forgetting that the flood and creation stories are just rip offs of enuma elish and Gilgamesh. They aren't even Christian in origin
