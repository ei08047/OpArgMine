[quote=Nu Leader]To Dzeron:  * The fact that we do not have any undisputed transitional fossils. More information about this and some other fossils that show that they must have been formed catastrophically during Noah's Flood can be found by clicking on this link.  * The fact that the second law of thermodynamics denies molecules to man evolution; more can be found out on the following site:  http://www.christiananswers.net/q-ed...odynamics.html  QUOTE]  Don't have time to refute everything from the pratt list, but I picked these two, and others can do the rest.  1) We have tons of undisputed transitional fossils. Try here...  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html and here...  http://www.geo.ucalgary.ca/~macrae/talk_origins.html  The problem isn't that there aren't any transitional fossils, the problem is that creationists refuse to accept any of them as transitional.  Example. Take a color chart that has all the colors between blue and yellow. What creationists do is draw a line halfway between the two and then claim that everything on one side is blue, and everything on the other side is yellow. They ignore the fact that there are many shades in between.  Regarding the 2nd law of thermodynamics, the claim would only make sense in a closed system. Earth isn't a closed system because of the heat we receive from the sun, and the suns entropy increases. Think of it this way. If the sun were to suddenly wink out then the temperature on earth would quickly become absolute zero (-459 degrees F) and all life on earth would cease. Make sense?  Bob Riggins wrote a wonderful essay on this subject a while back. It's here...  http://members.aol.com/darrwin/thermo.htm
