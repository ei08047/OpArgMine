Thank you for basically admitting that Pandion's argument is correct. We did not evolve from apes. Apes didn't even exist. We evolved from primitive primates, along with apes, chimps, orugantans, etc. How would they evolve into a new species of human? That would require them to be on a very similar evolutionary path as us, and obviously, they are not. Just like a shark cannot evolve into barracuda, they cannot evolve into a human.
