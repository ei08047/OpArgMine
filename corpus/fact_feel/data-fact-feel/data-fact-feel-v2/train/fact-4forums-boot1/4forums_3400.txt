The imapct that killed the dinosaurs happened about 65 million years before people showed up. It had absolutely nothing to do with the last ice age, which was only about 18,000 years ago. The two are utterly unrelated.  Being an omnivore does have certain advantages, but remember that many large carnivores and herbivores, like smilodons and mastadons, thrived during the ice age. Diet alone is clearly not the determining factor on why any given species made it through the ice age.
