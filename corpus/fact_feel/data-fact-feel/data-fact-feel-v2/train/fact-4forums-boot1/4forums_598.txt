I agree with that. Several companies made enough extended magazines in anticipation of the ban that they're still available for a reasonable price ten years later. As a business person the only question is going to be if grandfather rights will again be available if new legislation is passed. I spoke with a gun dealer I know who said manufacturer distributors are already calling dealers trying to determine what post-ban demand might be for pre-ban configurations. Bushmasters will be selling like hotcakes.
