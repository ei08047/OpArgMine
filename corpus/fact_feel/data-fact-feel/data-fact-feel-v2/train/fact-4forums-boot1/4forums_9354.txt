Schumer is a bonafide XXXXX, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.  It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.
