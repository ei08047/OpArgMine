Only a handful of the 300+ million people that live in America actively participate in the use of illegal drugs. Blaming all of America for their desire to break the laws and throw away money is dishonest.  Stop blaming gun owners for the problems in Mexico. You obviously hate this country so much, move out and go over to Britain.
