So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence, but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa, despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, is not?  In new york, the reduction in crime was the result of an overhaul of police and the criminal justice system. Couple pages on that:  http://www.city-journal.org/html/15_1_ny_crime.html  http://www.ny.gov/governor/patrecord/crime.html  New York started instituting prohibitive firearms laws in the 60s. Most of the firearms laws they  enjoy  now were put in place in the 70s (except for a brief round of idiocy in the 90's having to do with semi-auto rifles.... assault weapons , which they banned despite the fact that the police commissioner of NY City testified that they had no record of one ever being used in a crime).  So, they had prohibitive gun control for 30+ years, and then when they spent billions on theri criminal justice system and police, none of which had anything to do with gun control, their crime rate started to fall, and somehow you want us to believe that this was due to the gun control? Nobody here is that gullible.
