Actually National Geographic is more accepting of the truth than biased for the argument.  Evidence always speaks for itself.  It is by its very existence, evidence!  When studying with an open mind, one does not attach regilious beliefs to scientific exploration.  One does not creat hoax relics in the openminded search for the truth regarding our history.  One believes established historical facts as a background for research, not as an answer box for the daily questions that arrive during our trek into the past.  Strict Creationists came to the conclusion that the Bible was literally true before they were presented with the evidence that it cannot be so.  Entirely not so. The evidence supporting Creationism is the Bible, written by man, bought and sold in many languages all over the world. The evidence supporting evolution is piled up in museums and institutional collections all over the world. The only evidence that the Creationists are right is that someone said so and we wrote it down. The evidence of evolution is here to touch, study, age-date and ponder. The 6000 year old earth story has been debunked.  Maybe that's your biggest problem, thinking that they're totally opposite. The only thing that messes up the Biblical pie is the time line and our interpretation of how God works.  Understanding what we know now about orbital physics and why space things are almost always spherical in shape, it's laughable to think that the Earth was here before the Sun. Remember, you are reading from things written before man figured out that the Earth is not flat.  No, the Sun was before the Earth, the Earth before the Moon and the tides before intelligent life.  You can take that to the bank!
