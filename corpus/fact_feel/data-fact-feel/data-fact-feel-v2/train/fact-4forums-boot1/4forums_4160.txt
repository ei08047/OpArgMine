Just imagine if firearme safety was as heavily promoted in schools as sex education is. If we were to train children how to handle firearms, I feel confident that we could reduce accidental shootings, which the gun control crowds claim as one of their goals. No more of the  I thought it was unloaded  or  it just went off accidentally.  Ironically, I believe that federal gun-free school zones coupled with zero-tolerance policies make it nearly impossible for this to happen. Gun control could be costing children's lives. Or maybe it's just Darwinism in action.
