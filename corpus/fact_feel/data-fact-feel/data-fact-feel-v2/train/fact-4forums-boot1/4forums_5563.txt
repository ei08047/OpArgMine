Sandy suppose you lived in New York and knew it was 3000 miles between California and New York Now suppose there was a car that was parked in your driveway that you also knew had been driven from California and that car had a maximum speed of 100 miles per hour. That would of course mean it would have taken at least 30 hours to make the drive. Do you see how you could deduce that the car was at least 30 hours old?  ThatÂ’s the same principle used for dating the stars and the universe. If we know how far away a star is and we know the maximum speed of light, then the star must be at least as old as the time it would take for the light to get to the earth so we could see it.
