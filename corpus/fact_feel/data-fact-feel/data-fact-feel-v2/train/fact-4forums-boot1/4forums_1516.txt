Like my Rabbi said, some people take the Bible a little too literally.  My Rabbi has taught me to use the Bible as a guide, not a law. God loves all his creatures regardless.  Please don't preach your Christian hate speeches to me...I am still human afterall.  Just because the majority of US Citizens claim to be Christian doesn't mean our government should throw out the secular basis for our constitution. There are other Americans who aren't Christian that still have the same rights as any other person in the US.
