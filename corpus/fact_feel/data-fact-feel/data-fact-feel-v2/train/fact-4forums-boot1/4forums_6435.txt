You'll find that abortion targets none of these:  national, ethnical, racial or religious group(s).   Unwanted, unborn children is not a specific group. Nor are members of any group specifically targeted for abortion. The practice in open to all in the US.  Sorry. But all that shows is an abundant level of ignorance.  Now, if you can show that abortion is only used to cull the Romany populations in East Europe...then you may have a point.
