It has nothing to do with  evolutionists  and  creationists . Some people are confused about relativity theory. According to relativity, the speed of light is constant, so a lightyear is a constant. The speed of light is unaffected by any changes in the observer's time frame caused by gravity or speed. Regardless of whether we sit in a black hole, a white hole, a bounded universe or an unbounded one, if light from a star has taken 10 billion years to reach us, then the universe is at least 10 billion years old.
