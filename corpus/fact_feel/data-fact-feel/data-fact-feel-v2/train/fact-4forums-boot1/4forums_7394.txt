Let me pose a hypothetical question.  Same scenario as yours above but instead there is a genetically normal zygote on one table or on the other table, there is a mentally retarded newborn baby...which one will you choose if you had 2 seconds to choose?  You see life is existant at both stages, at the single cell and the newborn baby, but our view (sometimes ignorance, sometimes selfishness) is why we choose what we choose.  So do tell me which one you will choose?
