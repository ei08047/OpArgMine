This argument is a poor one for the following reasons;  If there is no  sanctity of life , that is people do not have a right to their own bodies, then a woman can not have a right to an abortion, since the right to an abortion depends on this very same principle.  Specific rights, like  right to an abortion ,  right to free speech  are not free floating propositions, they are part of a structure of rights which is logically intertwined. The supporting superstructure cannot be removed while leaving the specific rights intact.  Clearly a baby is both genetically distinct from the mother, and at least at some stage in development acquires a completely independent biological system and consciousness. I'm not sure what you mean by this.  I also don't see how your  worldview  can determine these things, whether a baby is a bodily function of a woman or not seems to me a case of empirical fact, not ideology.
