I made no such equivalent criticism - which would have been along the lines of 'There may well be no designer, which would rule out design'. I don't want or need to invoke unknowable unknowns to criticise ID. You're speculating about just such a thing, the likelihood of which is unquantifiable, whereas we know that patterns arise in nature in the absence of design. Moreover, you're hypothesising a natural bias that prevents the most fit variants from proliferating - but that very bias would disqualify them as 'most fit' and make something else 'most fit' instead.
