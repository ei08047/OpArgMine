No, it doesn't. Our genotype (together with other epigenetic modifiers) gives us a much bigger brain than chimps, although it is structured very similarly.  On top of that, what we accomplish with our bigger brain is, as I've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children, greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy. We teach our children to problem-solve. We teach them language and abstract thought - we train the various parts of the brain to do their job properly. We aren't born 'complete'. Even as adults, not everyone is equally quick-witted, not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development.  Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree, sure, but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable.
