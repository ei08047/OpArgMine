Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.  But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?  Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?
