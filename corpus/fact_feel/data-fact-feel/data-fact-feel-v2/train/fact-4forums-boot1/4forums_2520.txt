Oh good grief newbies are all the same on this forum...  Honestly, how many times do you think I've heard the Exodus and Numbers quote on this forum given my post count and join date? Do a search on the Exodus one...easy to see that is wrong.  The Numbers quote has nothing to do with who or who isn't valuable to God. That's like saying counting people over the age of 40 years old means everyone below is not a person.
