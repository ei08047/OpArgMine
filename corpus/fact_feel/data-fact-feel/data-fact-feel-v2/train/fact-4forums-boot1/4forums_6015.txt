From a developmental standpoint for the baby, there would have been no difference in killing the baby right before it exited the birth canal (a 3rd trimester abortion) and killing it right after it exited the birth canal. So I'm having a hard time understanding why you would think it to be preferable for her to have had an abortion. Of course I think they are the same because both what she did AND abortion murders the baby--its the same difference regardless of whether it happens before or after the baby exits the birth canal. But it seems to me that a consistent stance on your part would be to support her actions either way, because either way the mother has had her wish, which seems to be your top priority. Not that I agree with your thinking of course.
