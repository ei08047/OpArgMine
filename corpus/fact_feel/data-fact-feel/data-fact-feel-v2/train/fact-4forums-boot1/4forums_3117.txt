I think it's pretty clear that this is in violation of the Supreme Court's current abortion jurisprudence, at least to the extent that one could actually figure that out. The question is, are there enough justices on the Supreme Court who would reverse the judge-made Constitutional Amendment which granted an absolute right to abortion.  This would not solve the problem as there would be many out there who would claim that they cannot be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs are available just like they can't be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs aren't available.  There really is nothing wrong with the States posessing power. In fact, it is quite in line with the Constitution if the States really did have more power than the Federal Government, which by the way, I do not believe is the case today.
