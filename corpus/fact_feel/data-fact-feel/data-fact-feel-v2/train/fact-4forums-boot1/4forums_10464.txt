No. This is just more evidence that Archaeopteryx was a theropod dinosaur. As one of the articles I read stated, this is the nail in the coffin. Some of the characteristics that seemed to be more bird-like in other specimens can be seen to actually be dinosaurian. For good reason were two specimens classified as Compsognathus .
