The Supreme Court ruled that the definition of  arms  may absolutely NOT, under any circumstances, be limited to 18th century technology, or any other cutoff point. This means that the man on semi-automatic firearms (misknown as machineguns because a 12 round magazine exists somewhere in the world) can easily be overturned. This means that the people living in DC will soon be able to own Glocks and 1911s and Beretta 92s, as well as AK-47s and AR-15s and M1As and Mini-14s and all other kinds of modern weaponry.  There's one reason, and one reason only that the ban of semi-automatics is still on the books, and it's because it wasn't one of the points addressed in the lawsuit. The ban on handguns in general was addressed, not the ban on the type of handguns. However this can easily be dealt with.
