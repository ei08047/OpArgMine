So this list was a surprise to you? This isn't the first time that the  challange to come up with one scientist who believed that humans do not share common ancestry with apes  has come up on these forums. When refuted, the goal posts move, and it's shown how several scientists who don't believe in common ancestry are dwarfed by percentages of those who do, with of course, a dose of ridicule thrown in. Is that how students are sometimes  educated  in today's universities? A false implication is made to belittle creation as much as possible, and if not questioned, is quickly built upon? And if questioned, the goalposts are moved and the questioner is riduculed?
