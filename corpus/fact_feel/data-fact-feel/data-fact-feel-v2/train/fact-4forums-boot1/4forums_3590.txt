Of course throughout the whole Genome Project, although they have searched high and low for the gay gene, and they know where to look, they can't seem to find it. But I wouldn't deny that some chemical screw up in the fetal stage of development might not impact the sexual proclivities in some human beings. But so what if that is true?  According to the bible, the sin nature affects all aspects of our lives from diseases to the aging process to unnatural proclivities to sins such as rape, murder, adultery, homosexuality, incest, susceptibility to sex, alcohol and drug addiction, and innumerable other activities of the flesh which declare that we are seriously flawed due to our fall from grace which was brought about by our original sin of rebellion against God by disobeying Him via Adam and Eve. So there exists no consensus at all which declares that the liberal/secular humanist interpretation of reality is in any way correct. But that doesn't stop your side from claiming victory as the correct interpreters of the non-evidence.
