But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities. Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments. Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct. And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population. The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.  That isn't apparent from the abstract. And I'm not in a position to  purchase  the full article.  Right. We don't know. But it does appear from the universality of the genetic code that all life had a common ancestor. Of course, since you understand evolutionary theory, you are aware that the common ancestor is a population of reproducing organisms.  Exactly. What are you debating? Are you arguing that several identical genetic codes arose more than once?  I'm not sure of your point. So the first  event of compartmentalisiation  went extinct because of excessive ultraviolet exposure or the like. No one is claiming that the first reproducing molecule is the origin of all life. What is claimed is that all life is descended from a single ancestor.
