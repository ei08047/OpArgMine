Funny but I doubt you could spin that past Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and others. You need only look at making institutions that weren't around at that time guilty of having slave owning roots by buying institutions that were. Having racist roots does not absolve the pro slavers or gun control fanatics of being racist. Rather the opposite I'd say.
