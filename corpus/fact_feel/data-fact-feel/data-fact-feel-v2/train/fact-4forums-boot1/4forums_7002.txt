What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper &amp; deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -  until, as you said: Hopefully, the person  finds some way of forgiving themselves , right.  But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research &amp; quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.  Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.  Annie
