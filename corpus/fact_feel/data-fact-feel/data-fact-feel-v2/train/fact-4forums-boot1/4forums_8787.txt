So thatÂ’s it Â– thereÂ’s nothing else to study on the subject? The process you describe naturally takes long periods of time. Do you wonder if, during this process, information/health/life could lie dormant for long periods of time, or if it would have to make some of its changes close to the time when other things changed, or when the system became operational? In mid-2001, the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics jointly presented the true nature and complexity of the digital code inherent in DNA. We now understand that each human DNA molecule is comprised of chemical bases arranged in approximately 3 billion precise sequences. Even the DNA molecule for the single-celled bacterium, E. coli, contains enough information to fill all the books in any of the world's largest libraries. ID proponents are often accused of saying Â“goddidit, that settles it, stop lookingÂ”, and it seems that atheists do that quite often as well. Can you quote any ID proponent saying what you said, that Â“we donÂ’t need to develop exact pathsÂ…Â”? Behe can describe exploration of paths, that arenÂ’t being explored to any great extent now. (too religious, don't-cha-know ) In his words; Â“Since the simplest possible design scenario posits a single cell Â–formed billions of years ago Â– that already contained all information to produce descendant organisms, studies could test this scenario by attempting to calculate how much DNA would be required to code the information (keeping in mind that much of the information might be implicit) lf DNA alone is insufficient, studies could be initiated to see if information could be stored in the cell in other ways Â– for example, as positional information. Other work could focus on whether larger, compound systems (containing two or more irreducibly complex systems) could have developed gradually or whether there are compounded irreducibilities.Â”  Â“Blind, purposeless, happenstance nature did it, that settles it, stop lookingÂ”? Is that your answer? Is the type of study Behe describes something for atheists to be afraid of?
