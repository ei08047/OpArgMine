In theory true but it gets convoluted when the discussion focuses on information that is freely offered by a citizen that seems innocuous but is actually incriminating under certain situations. EZ-Pass could be used to issue speeding tickets; the authorities know the minimum time it should take to travel between exits . . . You do it in a shorter time and you are issued a ticket. You have provided the authorities the evidence of your criminality and the means to prove it - but is that self-incrimination?
