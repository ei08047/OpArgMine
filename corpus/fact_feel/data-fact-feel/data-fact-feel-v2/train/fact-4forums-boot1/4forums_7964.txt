I think the semi-tragic error supersport - and other strongly religious people - make when triumphantly posting links like this is that he assumes everyone invests their beliefs concerning the universe with the same degree of emotion and self-worth as he does. This assumption is explicitly stated on occasion, whenever 'darwinism' or evolution or some other scientific field of study is described as a 'religion'. To SS, the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs. The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement, anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him.
