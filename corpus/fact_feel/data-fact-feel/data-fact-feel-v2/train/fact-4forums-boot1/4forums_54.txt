No it doesn't!  It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.  It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole.
