There was a study in Britain back in 1999 that concluded the risk of breast cancer following an abortion was trivial, almost as insignificant as getting lung cancer from a lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke - UNLESS it was the first pregnancy that was interrupted. If the first pregnancy was interrupted, the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer was right up there with the likelihood of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. (The study is obviously not politically correct, so I've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic.) The study didn't address causes, and only noted the correlation, but the lead doctor did speculate that it may have something to do with hormonal changes that need to run to completion.  Once again, the state of Florida takes the lead in losing and abusing its children.
