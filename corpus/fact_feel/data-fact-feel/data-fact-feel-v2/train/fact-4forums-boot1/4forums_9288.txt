And I am going to say to you one more time, take a class, I am not going to give it to you. There are millions of fossilized links showing slow and obvious changes. Horse fossils show a very gradual evolution to what is today considered the horse (but oh wait you knew that since you studied evolution so well with such and open mind.) There is also this little thing called punctuated equilibrium where there is a sudden large change (usually thought to have been caused by mutation) But again, since you studied evolution you knew about that.
