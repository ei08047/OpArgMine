It do work in Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Denmark as far as I´m aware of.  Did you know those contries existed? Maybe only the 'big-guys' like US, UK and australia are important? You can´t claim that gun control doesn´t work. There are many contries where it does.  Then, after all you have to see it in the proper timeframe. If UK and australia pretty recent aquired those gun-laws then yes, for a time crime might increase, but it will decrease with time.
