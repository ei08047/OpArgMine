Well, creationists claim he said that. However, there is no real evidence he ever did. They give two sources.. one says it is was in the 100th edition of the 'origin of species), and the other one was on the centinial edition (which is a real trick, since that is 4 years after his death). No one seems to be able to find the primary source for that quote. Imagine that.
