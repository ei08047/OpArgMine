Well, the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith.  If you say  I know there is no god,  this statement requires faith.  You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god.  The presence of religion has nothing to do with this faith and it's not a religion, just a gross assumption with no  proof.
