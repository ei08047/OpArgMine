Not a good week on the hominid front for Darwinists. First the homo habilis thing, now this (from your link):  ?This feature implies some level of Neanderthal ancestry in this otherwise modern human fossil,? the authors explain  Of course, this is not surprising since Neanderthal DNA is 99.9% the same as ours:  http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com...s.php?id=82519  Human/Neanderthal DNA 99.9% identical  Of course the problem here, is there is not enough time to go from Neanderthal morphology to  modern  morphology by way of RMNS. This is why science needs the Neanderthals be a different species and to go extinct, leaving no trace behind. But if modern humans descended from Neanderthals, darwinists will have to admit that the transformation happened nearly instantly.
