The claim that the gun buy-back in Australia caused the crime rate to increase has been refuted as an urban legend. http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/ausguns.htm  The people that make this claim are either ignorant or intentionally trying to mislead people. The same with the UK. From reading grayhawk and DHard3006's posts it appears that they get most of their information (or misinformation) from pro-gun websites. Do a little bit of research on your own.
