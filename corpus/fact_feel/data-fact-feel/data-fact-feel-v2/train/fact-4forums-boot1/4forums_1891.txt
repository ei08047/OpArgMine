Actually I did not know what Nato had posted. I found it quite interesting. I know that when I and my wife attended church, I thought about that possibility. Someone who Hates us just because we go to church, and I thought about bringing the problem up.  I quickly dismissed the probability of something like this happening because right across the street, is the Fairview Police Station. However, this is exactly where things like this do happen. In places where one is not allowed to carry a concealed firearm.
