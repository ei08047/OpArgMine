The best jokes are often the ones that have a touch of truth to them. There is at least some desire, however small, on the part of the scientific community to modernize religious beliefs. The link in post #1 quotes the Methodist guy as saying that there is no conflict between religion and science. Yet he said the issue had to be confronted to keep young people from leaving the church. Could that be because the scientific education establishment is teaching young people that there IS a conflict?  Did the first, fully formed people - Adam and Eve - actually exist or not? That could be a conflict.
