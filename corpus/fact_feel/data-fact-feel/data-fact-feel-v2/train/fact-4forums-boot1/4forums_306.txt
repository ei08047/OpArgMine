While we're on the subject, I've managed to conclusively disprove Intelligent (sic) Design. It's actually a remarkably simple thing to do when you realise that Nature is just far too complex to have been designed.  Look around you. We humans are perhaps the best designers that we know of. Look how crude are the things we make: the filthy, inefficient combustion engine; the computer, unable to make decisions of its own and unable to feel emotions; the microwave, unable to cool anything like a tasty meal. We are, at best, crude emulators of Nature.  No. No designer could possibly have kept track of all the interlocking wonders of the natural world, therefore there can't possibly have been one.  Also, the chances of a designer appearing ab initio in the Universe are of the order 1 in 5x10^90871. I worked it out.  I'll let the Discovery Institute know.
