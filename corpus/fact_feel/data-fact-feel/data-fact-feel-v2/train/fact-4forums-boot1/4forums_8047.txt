Yeah, sure your right. Take Ellen for example. It was not too long ago...or perhaps it was (I'm getting old) that she came out of the closet screaming about being gay...and how proud she was to finally be able to say it out loud. She and her partner/s have been at the front of headlines for years, and she actively speaks out on behalf of gay / lesbian groups. Yet she still seems to be above the anti-gay contempt of most. Does anyone think it is perhaps that most of America got to know her as a celebrity before they found out she was gay?
