You must be joking. I'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane.  Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US? If what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the US, but we don't.
