Well I don't support ever using the death penalty but as long as we're saying there is the death penalty and allowing them to choose then definately don't have retrials. They shouldn't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already. If they don't want to kill an innocent person, stick to life in prison.
