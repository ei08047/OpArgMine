It used to be thought that it was God who caused earthquakes or floods. Now, we know that earthquakes are caused by the movement of continental plates that are under stress. Floods are caused by a variety of reasons - too much rain floods rivers, a previously confined body of water bursts its bank once those banks eventually degrade, etc. Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety. Now we know that diseases strike indiscriminately (where piety is concerned) and affect people only based on their risk of acquiring the virus and their general state of health. There are many other examples.
