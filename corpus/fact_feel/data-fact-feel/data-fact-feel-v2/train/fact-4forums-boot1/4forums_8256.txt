Problem is, the child support isn't owed to the woman but the child. Before abortion, the child cannot claim any rights on anyone as it is not accepted as a person. Afterwards, it is a different issue.  On the other hand: if a woman raped a man and had children, would he be expected to pay support: I suspect not. There was a recent case where a woman gave a man a blowjob and then impregnated herself with the semen. Her suit for child support was rejected on the grounds that there was no way he could have expected birth to be the outcome.
