No, it tests whether he is all-powerful. The proof shows that the very notion of all-powerfulness leads to other notions that are absurd, such as the unbreakable rock or, someone else posted, the round square. This is called  reduction to the absurd  and it is a valid logical method. It has been used to prove that 1/0 is undefinable.  I stated that he cannot do something inside of his own nature, that is, his nature doubles back on itself and is contradictory. Similarly if someone spoke of something that is  both green and not green at the same time and in the same sense  I can disprove this statement using the Law of Non Contradiction. Of course, one can pull off the rubbish argument that  it is incomprehensible, therefore it is true.  As I stated earler, such an argument is fallacious.
