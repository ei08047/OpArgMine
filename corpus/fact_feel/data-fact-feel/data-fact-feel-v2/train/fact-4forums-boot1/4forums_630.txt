Is there some sort of irony you're aiming for?  You imagine I am religious, and begin attacking my imaginary faith. You then ask if I have anything of substance to add.  You criticise the religious folks here for claiming they have the TRUTH about god, while preaching that you have the TRUTH about god.  So yes, the substance I have here is that atheists who boast about being able to disprove the existence of gods are hypocrites. You claim to not believe in god, and then claim to have proof of things that only a god could. You make the rest of us atheists look bad with your reasonless and hate filled ramblings.
