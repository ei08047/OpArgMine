Uh oh, Mr. Poe's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing. This is where a Â“satireÂ” quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking, (designed to be something that could be innocence) to a complete lie. It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible. Atheist mockers donÂ’t seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe.
