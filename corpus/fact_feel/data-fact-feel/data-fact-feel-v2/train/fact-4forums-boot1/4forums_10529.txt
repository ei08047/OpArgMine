Burglars in Albany netted 12 guns from three break ins during the past week.  That recent proliferation of stolen guns led the Albany Police Department to issue a plea Thursday for gun owners to lock their guns in a safe place, preferably in a heavy-duty, secured gun cabinet, police Lt. James Williams said.  Burglars seem to know which homes have guns and are targeting them, Williams said. That is a major problem.  Straight forward enough you'd think but then as Paul harvey used to say, page 2.  Dozens of readers have taken issue with The Journal News over its decision to run a list of pistol permit holders in Westchester and Rockland counties as part of a wider investigative article.  The names of more than 30,000 licensed handgun owners were posted online as part of ?Falling Through the Cracks,? the paper?s Dec. 10 report that found that thousands of registered handguns were unaccounted for because there is no system to secure the weapons of permit holders who die.  Well duh!
