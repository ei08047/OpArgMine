So if women choose to abort for reasons of:  a) poverty  b) career  c) religion  d) family pressure  they are not freely choosing abortion? I'm convinced there's more air filling your head with every post you make. If I didn't know you, I'd swear this was an (almost as idiotic) pro-lifer post concerning the incapability of women to make their own decisions.
