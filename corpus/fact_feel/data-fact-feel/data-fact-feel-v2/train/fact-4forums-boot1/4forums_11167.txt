Your faulty logic is easy to spot:  Your only looking at the 26 decided cases listed by the VPC, 2 being slightly more than 92% of 26. But, your making the absurd assumption that the VPC listed all the aquitted or dismissed cases. Why would they? They were compiling a list of CCW murderers. It's far more likely they were screening out the dismissed and aquitted cases and missed these two.  Your 92% figure is lacking a solid basis and cannot be used to predict the outcome of the 49 pending cases.
