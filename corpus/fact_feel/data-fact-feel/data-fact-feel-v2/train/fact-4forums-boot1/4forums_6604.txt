Actually that is exactly what it is. A theory is nothing more then an explanation of the relation of observations.  Or from the Webster dictionary:  the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another  or from Wikipedia  A theory is in this context a set of hypotheses that are logically bound together  or from the text  Inquiry into Life  by Sylvia S. Mader  A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses.  I assume your refute stems from observations of the common refute that is used in refuting people who call a theory simply a  hunch  or  guess,  but as I did not define it in such a way your statment has been misapplied. A theory is in fact an  educated guess  based on fact (which I would of thought redundant) about how those facts may interact (which is what I pretty much stated above). You will most likely find no reputable source stating anything else (though they may use jargon) Scientific or other wise.
