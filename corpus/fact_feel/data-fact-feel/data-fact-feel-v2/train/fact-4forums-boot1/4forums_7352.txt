Public Schools in 3 more States are in the process of bringing a case to court  that will permit them to join those 5 States in dumbing down kids, via elimination of the word  Evolution  from all  Science  text books, while inserting religious mumbo jumbo called  creationism  into those  text  books.  There is no need to debate the ignorance shown in this forum. Simply look at the number of  views  for the thread here that asks how they fit all those animals in the ark, and you will find ignorance is self-evident.
