No one by the NAME of 'Jesus' EVER existed.  Fact.  What you're doing is worshiping someone by a different name than He was given.  No different that calling your Messiah Bill even though his given name was Phillip.  So, tell me, how much do you love your Personal, and friendly God when you can't even get His name right?   Depart from me...for I know not who you are.
