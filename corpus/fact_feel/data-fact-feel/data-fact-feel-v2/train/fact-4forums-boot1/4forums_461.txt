Religious institutions are now able to define marriage as they wish. For example, they need not recognize divorce or inter-faith couples, or even couples deemed to be incompatible by the religious official for any reason. The same is true of there not being a requirement to marry same-sex couples. Polygamy is a different topic, because it is not just unrecognized legally, polygamy is illegal.  Couples who married at city hall, before a JP, because they are non-religious, and it was important to them to not have a religious ceremony, will no longer be able to use the term.  Why is there a desire to get rid of state-recognized marriage now, at the possible prospect of the state recognizing a same-sex couple in marriage?
