Oh please get over yourself here. You know all too well that gays don't affect you or your livelyhood. But everything that was pointed out in the OP letter EFFECTS EVERYONE.  So, yes, there are other MUCH MORE important things to deal with.  What you don't seem to understand is that the whole issue of gay marriage is simply a distraction from the real messes all around.  Don't go pointing the  distraction  finger at US, when we're the ones calling people like you on them.
