You are too easily refreshed. Flew is not a biologist, and his assertion that  biologists' investigation of DNA has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved  is one that many biologists would challenge. Essentially, all Flew has concluded is that some Great Unknown Thing is responsible for the existence of life and the universe; and in common with most cultures throughout history he has named that Great Unknown Thing god.  Even if we were to accept this reasoning, the GUT that Flew envisages is a million light years from the anthropomorphic and anthropocentric tyrant-father invoked by the Middle Eastern monotheisms. He has conspicuously omitted from his statements any notion that it is interested in (or even aware of) humankind, let alone that it requires our worship. He does not, you will note, believe in an afterlife.  Professor Flew is entitled to his opinions, as are we all; and his assertion that the level of complexity observed in living organisms requires a non-naturalistic explanation is just that - his opinion. That said, any christian crowing over Flew's 'conversion' is clutching at a pretty slender straw.
