So, I assume that you bought all of the liberal demogoguery about the big health insurance companies making obscence profits on the backs of dying people?  Here's a little factual info for you. There was a recent ranking on the profitability of a wide variety of Industry types. I believe it was done by Forbes. The health care insurance companies ranked 35th in profitability with an ROI of 2.2%. To put that in perspective, if the companies fired all of their employees and converted all of their assets to cash, they'd have made more money putting in in a bank and drawing interest.
