Let's do some math,... The average American already works halfway through the month of April paying the government it's share of our earned income. That's over a third of our total gross income and for some Americans and businesses, it is nearly 50%.  And yet, you are saying that we need only pay a little bit more,... and we can have FREE ( ) Healthcare.  The same government that Spends 15 dollars to give ONE to a person in need, is going to give us  FREE  (Gawd I love that word),...  FREE Healthcare?  Free?  Must be that new math.  You see, for every single dollar the government spends on someone in need,... it has to take at least three dollars from you, me and everyone else. Their (the governments) buildings, cars and infrastructures has to be maintained, government employees financial needs and payroll must be met, their benefits provided, computers, telephones, jails, judges, convicts tried, housed, fed, defended, parks, roads, bridges,... our miltary (remember them?)  And finally,... our helthcare.  Senator Phil Grahm said it right,...  we've reached the point in time where there are more people in the wagon than there are able to pull it!   Live free or die trying!
