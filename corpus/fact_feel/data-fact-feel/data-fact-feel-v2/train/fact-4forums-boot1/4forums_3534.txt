Sigh. You defend your version of science by re-stating the definition of your version of science. That is circular reasoning.  If you read anything on the history of science you will know that your version is but one of many.  Isaac Newton sought out the hand of God, through science. He is a prime example of what I mean. He thought differently about science than you... as science could be used as a tool for furthering his understanding of God.
