[quote]this fact alone dispells the notion that we?re in the process of increasing in complexity, as darwinists insist [/Quote}  Darwinists insist on no such thing. Complexity can come and go in evolution. For example free living organisms with complex structure can become parasites with minimum structure and greatly reduced complexity. For an explanation of what complexity can be defined as see the Adami paper.  Prove it!  Before laying out the various relationships perhaps you should prove your initial assertion and key assumption that  the mind and mental processes are in control of the genome  I would be most interested in how you can control your own genes. Can you change your eye color at will for example??? WOW.  Yes it is the follower, it binds information about an organisms environemnt into the genome. It may (but need not) follow the changing fitness landscape which is only static for limited periods.  Basically you have conflated the external environment with the mind. An odd error but still one you have made. Once more read ADAMI!
