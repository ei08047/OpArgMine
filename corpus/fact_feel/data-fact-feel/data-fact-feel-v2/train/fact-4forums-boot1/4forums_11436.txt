My post #1, combined with what unkerpaulie copy/pasted from my deleted post, makes my position clear enough. If anyone else shows an interest, we'll go from there. We'll give it one month....11-31-09. If no one bites by then, you can just delete this whole thread, Mr moderator. I'll then decide if I start this in the creo/evo forum here, or if I take it to the EvC forums.
