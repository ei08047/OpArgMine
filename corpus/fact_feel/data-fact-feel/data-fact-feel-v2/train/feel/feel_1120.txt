But why does this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submitted to with their parental oversight ? How is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? Are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ?
And if so, do you then also believe that a 13-15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? Or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? Because those are also adult decisions and it doesn't seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they're not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions. Kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking, you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life.
