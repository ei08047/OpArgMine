Well both could be a good mother because i know a mother who was very certain she didn't want her baby and went for an abortion but was too late on in her pregnancy to have one and then she was going to give himup fpr adoption but as soon as he was born she loved him and couldn't bear to give him up and know she's a great Mum. Being a good mother mainly depends on what you are like with you're child after birth.
