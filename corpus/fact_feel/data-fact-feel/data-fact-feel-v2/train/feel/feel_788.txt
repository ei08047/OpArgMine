Actually, one could also cite the success of Chinese merchants all over the world, South Korean capitalists in the U.S. and quite a number of other non-Europeans around the world.
Do all of these groups hold values in common? Or, is there a distinct brand of Hindu capitalism as opposed to Chinese capitalism as opposed to South Korean capitalism? And, I'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion.
I'm not sure I approve of Hayek's take on capitalism, though.
