You know something, I just came here to browse, but upon discovering that you feel that people who believe in God are stupid, and their beliefs are stupid, just ###### me off. Not that you dont believe, but your use of the word stupid. I happen to be one of those stupid people you refer to, and so I will say this- People can say or believe whatever they want to, but we are all going to die one day, and something will be waiting on us when we do die, so before you start calling people names, I would explore the possibility that maybe christians are right, because in the inescapable end, we will all find out. And if we as christians are right, your eternal future dont look to good. And one more little thought, people thought the guy who said the world was round was stupid, but he was right in the end.
