Nothing that prevents it communicating in theory, but I have covered the communication aspect already in this post. 
The idea that we are 'image bearers of the divine' comes purely from human religions, and has no concrete basis. The atoms in my body were created by nuclear fusion in the centres of stars that exploded billions of years ago. Rather than being imago dei, we are stardust. I find that idea far more grandiose and appealing than divine providence.
I'm sure you'll have more questions!
Anyone else got more than a trite one-liner on their idea of God (or whatever you think he/she/it is)?
