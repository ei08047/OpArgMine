Go on and show everyone here which of us is posting irrational drivel. Show me your simple observations of wisdom which I can't comprehend. You can't because there are no quotes or simple observations, nor is there any wisdom since you've never had an original thought to your credit and wouldn't know what to do with one if you did.
So go on with your irrational tirade if you like, but stop lying about contributing some actual on topic content to this debate when you have contributed nothing substantial or real at all. Got it?!?! emoticonXDonno
