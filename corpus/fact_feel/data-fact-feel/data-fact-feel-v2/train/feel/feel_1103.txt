Today I was driving my son and two of his team-mates to basketball practice. One of the kids used the word gay in a derogatory manner. I asked him not to. My son said "ya, my dad is gay." No teasing, no name calling, a few curious a questions and back to basketball.
My son has also been thrown to floor of the bus and force fed garbage for asking a kid to not use the word "gay" in a derogatory manner.
Do you really think the solution is to prevent gay people from forming families so mean kids can have free reign to be little asses? Or maybe the fact that a kid has gay parents isn't the real issue.
I would also like to point out that your argument fails to address the thousands of gay parents who have BIOLOGICAL children.
