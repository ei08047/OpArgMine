As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.
As for caring for the kid once they're here, that can be costly. More so for time. If you're poor, EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child's cost (the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers). You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money. 
But, we're talking adoption.
On top of these decisions, you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion. 
It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.
As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life, watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson. Then smile as it IS the XXXXXX who are inheriting the world. But, what would you care? You won't be here...and most likely, neither will your decendents.
If you want to kill it, then just kill it and say 'What's it too you?' or even 'Yeah, so I'm selfish and didn't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details, bugger off ya wanker!'
