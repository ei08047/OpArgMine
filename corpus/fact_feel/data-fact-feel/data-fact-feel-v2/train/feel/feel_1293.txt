I understand your points... all I am saying is that these are issues that come up.. not saying that these are the ONLY issues... I'm not judging that the rapist in the example wasn't craving affection or anything like that... I'm not judging anyone on that one... my point was that if a woman is raped and becomes pregnant, she has become pregnant through no choice of her own. But I am not about to take the side of a rapist... I don't care how abused they were. When I said that the woman would be reliving the rape, I didn't mean that they wouldn't otherwise... but think if you were a woman and were raped, and became pregnant by someone you didn't know or know anything about... 
As for the murder part of it, what is it called when anti-abortionists picket outside clinics and shoot and kill the abortion doctors? Is that not murder? Doesn't that make them hypocrites?
