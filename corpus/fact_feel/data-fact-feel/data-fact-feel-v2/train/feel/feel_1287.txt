Translation: Anti-abortionist intellectuals aren't really opposed to abortion as an end in itself, they only oppose abortion because they believe forcing women to remain pregnant is an appropriate punishment for their True Sin, sex outside of marriage.
The goal isn't to "prevent murder" at all, this is merely a convenient excuse to punish women who stray from traditional relationships.
That's why those opposed to abortion are also opposed to contraception, even though contraception prevents abortion.
So the fact that abortion protestors also prevent people from accessing contraception isn't contradictory at all, it is completely in line with their goals.
