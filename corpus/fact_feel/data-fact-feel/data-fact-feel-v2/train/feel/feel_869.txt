I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost. 'If you have to ask, you can't afford it'. I'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons couldn't afford them, but if the interest isn't already there, it's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question.
