They should be discredited, and their hypocrisy should be exposed. Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry, supposedly in "defense" of "traditional marriage," when some of them are out sneaking around, cheating on their wives, and lying about it when confronted. The only reason this guy admitted the truth is because evidence surfaced about his visits to prostitutes. Meanwhile, has has tried to advance his political career at the expense of gay people. Some defender of marriage! 
This is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye.
