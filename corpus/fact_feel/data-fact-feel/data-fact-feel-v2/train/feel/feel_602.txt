1. I consider my arguments to be "anti-elective abortion" not "pro-life." And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two. "Pro-lifers" approach the abortion debate from an "all life is sacred" generally religious based point of view. I do not. I neither believe that "all life is sacred" nor that "god" or religion should be used in the debate at all.
2. My argument that a "human individual's life biologically begins at conception" is not an "assumption." It's is a conclusion reached by an indepth study of the facts and references available.
