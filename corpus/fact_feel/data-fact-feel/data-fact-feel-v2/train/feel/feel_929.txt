What if pigs had wings, they would make huge birds. But what do "what ifs" have to do with what really happened? The child didn't die and if it had, it wouldn't have been an abortion, it would have been between murder at the most, and negligent homicide, if not manslaughter, but not an abortion by any stretch of the law's interpretation since abortions are legal. And had the fetus died, the cops would have been charged with a crime. 
This is what's wrong with the premise of antonia's thread subject here, yet she couldn't discern that before posting this since she was intent on finding an avenue to attack pro-lifers with. And you are as irrational as she is for not seeing through her fallacious argument. After all, she can't even see how utterly hypocritical it is to blame pro-lifers for what occurred in this article while remaining oblivious to the carnage her pro-death ideology is responsible for to the tune of 1.4 million innocent children being killed each year in the USA alone.
