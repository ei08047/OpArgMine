It's wonderful that we as humans can do to help others through procedures like this. Very happy for this little girl.
I am, however, astonished and outraged that our CITIZENS in the UNITED STATES have to go to CHINA to get a treatement like this to help them.
It is absolutely disgusting what is happening to our country due to religious nuts/fundies who oppose stem cell research and various other advances in science. Sometimes I think they won't be happy until this country becomes a third world country at least techologically and scientifically.
