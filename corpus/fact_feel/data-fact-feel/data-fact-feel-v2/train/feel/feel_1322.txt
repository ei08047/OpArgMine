And a woman's life choices, health, and finances aren't up for hi-jacking. Every time a lifer talks about demanding the nine month rape, they talk about what the baby deserves or not deserves and how it shouldn't be punished. This SCREAMS that you don't value and respect women. The very idea that a woman is aborting as an act of revenge - it's absurd and insulting.
