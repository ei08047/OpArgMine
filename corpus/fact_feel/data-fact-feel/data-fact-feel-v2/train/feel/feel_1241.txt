With all due respect my friend, this is foolishness. It's as if you're saying that a persons existence is based on their memories from their past. That is ridiculous because if it's true then, we oughta take every person who's in the throws of Alzhiemers out and euthanize them because they can't remember what they did yesterday. Just because you can't remember what you did at 4 doesn't negate for one moment that you still existed at 4 so your existence had value and substance even though you can no longer remember what happened back then in your life.
