So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted?
While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room, down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
