The issue is about you linking an incident where a pregnant woman had so little regard for her unborn baby that she picked a fight with the police and somehow use it to demonise the police and the pro life people.
I could not imagine anyone could be stupid enough to do this without the aid of strong drink but thank you for reminding me that you can do it easily.
