Doesn't matter if it is 5 months or 8 months (all of which is done) or 1 month...it is a person inside another...why does that make a difference? I suppose you are a "cancer" too? So I guess we assume you comment should read " Her body her choice so long as she is not inside another person and none of anyone elses business." Surely is a random thought but I would like to have one of my own. I think that if I kill someone else in my own home then it is no one elses business but my own. Sound weird?? I agree...just like your statement.
