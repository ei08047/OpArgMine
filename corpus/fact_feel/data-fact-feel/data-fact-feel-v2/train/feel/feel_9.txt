What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality? The definitions were accurate. It would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation. How about some evidence to support the "theory."
By the way, I'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed. What you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under "evolution," wasn't it?
