At least your husband and yourself survived the adventure. Only one became a victim by the adorably nice people "inside" the building. Ironic. 
What motivated the evil mean people outside the building? Hatred for you? A person they have never met? Or concern for a life that they have never met? 
You willingness to kill your baby removes any surprise that one might have at your desire to slap the faces of people concerned for the welfare of "your" child.
