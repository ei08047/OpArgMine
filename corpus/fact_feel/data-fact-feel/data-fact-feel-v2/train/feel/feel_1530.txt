Typical little child, all he can offer is condescending insults while never daring to refute the arguments made. But you're in good company as that is all your cohorts can do also. You must reject and denigrate that which is just as reasonable an explanation of the available evidence as your side offers. That's why it's a waste of time going around in circles with you guys. But I've made my point. Again,
What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it. But for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is, is the epitome of arrogance. We may have to agree to disagree peeling, but don't you dare just assume you're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely.
