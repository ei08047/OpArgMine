And thats my point, science operates on it's means of accesing valid mechanisms. That said, science will only allow what IT decides is "valid", just like the church.
Science defines what is valid and what isn't, just like the church.
"Instantaeneous" comunication and large volumes of scientists does NOT make science any more right, it meerly increases the volume of stuff that they come up with.
And again, your point brings back the arguement that when technology proggresses further we may still discover things which force science to re-write their books. Your view is purely subjective, even the evidence itself is opinion.
