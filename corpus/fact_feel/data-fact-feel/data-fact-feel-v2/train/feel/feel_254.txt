Did you read the TOPIC? Evidently not! Your assignement, should you attempt to take it, is to state your thesis and prove it by fact and not guess and assumptions and WA claims. I have no interest in trying to prove some wall eyed statement from a mouth breather. :) It is not my job to try to prove your hypotehesis based on guess and innuendo. The facts have been in long ago, posted and you ignored them now you come in to MUDDY THE WATERS AND PRETEND FACTS NEVER EXISTED.
