What do I have against abortion? Hmmm, let me think. I guess there is that little fact that it is MURDER! But besides that "opinion", it does effect me because it effects society in a negative way. Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions? Look here  to see what I mean. Do a search for "effects of abortion" on the Web and see if you don't find many more studies with the same results. I could have posted many more links. Maybe you don't know about these studies since the leftist media and women's groups tends to ignore them. Maybe you just ignore them because they don't fit into your world view. Either way, the facts are there.
