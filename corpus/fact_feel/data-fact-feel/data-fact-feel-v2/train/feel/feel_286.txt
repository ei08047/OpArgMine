It's called an analogy. The article claimed that the relationship between homosexuals and discrimination and between gun owners and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of "who they are." Thus, I extended this analogy so that the relationship between gun owners and discrimination and between serial racists and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of "who they are." The analogy that I made was not comparing gun owners to serial rapists, but rather, it was comparing the relationship of the two groups with discrimination.
And what is your deal with lunatic fringe leftie? Antigun laws are clearly not a fringe view, or gun control laws would not have been passed in Congress. You can hardly call the views lunatic. I doubt any doctor would agree that a person with liberal views regarding gun control is mentally insane.
My anti-freedom agenda? What the hell are you talking about? Are you an anarchist? That's the only way to have 100% freedom. The fact that government exists means that there are restrictions. So unless you are an anarchist, I can call you anti-freedom as much as you call me anti-freedom. The question is the degree to which government should restrict freedoms, and that is not an obvious question to answer.
Can you please explain how my views on gun control reveal that I'm racist. Have I proposed a law which would restrict gun usage for only a certain race?
