You are clearly against the Iraq War, and this isn't what I was planning to debate. I think the Pro-lifers have an edge on the contradiction between abortion and the death penalty because one is the ending of an innocent life, while the other is of a guilty personâ€™s life. I think every soldier who gives his life in a justified or an ambiguous war should be honored by all Americans for giving his or her life for their country, and yes, I do believe they are patriots!
