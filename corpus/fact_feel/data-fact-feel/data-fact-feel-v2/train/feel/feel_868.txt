If this thread is intended to be read only by those with a technical expertise 
in logical analysis, then my low-tech approach will make you groan. However,
I'm still puzzled by the idea that "logical necessity must exist in every reality"
when this idea is applied to a particular problem. I can see that 
interior to logical reasoning, "necessity" must exist in every reality - otherwise 
what we understand as "logic" would not be that but something else.
To simplify: 
All my friends are Irish
Sheila is my friend
So Sheila is Irish. 
(The same sort of logical necessity applies (I think) to propositions involving
mathematics: 6+2 = 8 cannot be refuted because 6+2 is just another way
of writing 8.)
As Sheila exists in the real world, the information about her contained in the
syllogism also happens to be factually true.
But the necessary truths of logic including the proposition that God exists,
are deduced from applying the rules of logic and are not necessarily factual
truths and seem to have the same status as Sheila would if she existed only as an idea.
