Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............
They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....
It won't happen.get use to it................
