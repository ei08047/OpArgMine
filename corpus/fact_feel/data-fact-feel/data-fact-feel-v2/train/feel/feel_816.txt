I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant?
That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony! emoticonXGood
