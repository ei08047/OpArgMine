You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.
I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you.
