So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a "baby" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? 
For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.
Abortion should be pro-choice.
