I've always disliked this line of logic because it implies that the value of somebody's life depends on their relative accomplishments and it invites the counter argument that the unborn in question could also become a criminal. Indeed, it has been argued that abortion has reduced crime, poverty, overpopulation and the depletion of natural resources.
