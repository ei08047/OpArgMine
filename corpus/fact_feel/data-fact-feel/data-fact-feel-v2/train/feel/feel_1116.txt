Yes.... 10% of the population has a disorder (homosexuality) that they refuse to deal with in the proper way do to the fact they believe that the majority should just except there so called "sexual orientation" and treat it like it is as normal as a traditional relationship between a man and a woman. I'm sorry, but I cannot except this concept that your "orientation" is on the same playing field as mine. It is not. Abdominable and wrong behavior do not deserve rights.
