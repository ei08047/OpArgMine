No one really dragged anyone, marc.
I was doing what is called "making a joke." You need a sense of humor to understand this.
The idea behind the humor was that it seems that in 2008 any person or institution that does not understand that evolution is a fact is indeed backward in their thinking. In that they finally recognized a commonly accepted fact so late, it would seem they were hitherto reluctant. Hence the "kicking and screaming" reference.
Sheesh, if you have to explain it...
