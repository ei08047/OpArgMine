So your answer is to just continue with the way things are now: continue forcing the law-abiding to go unarmed and let only the shooter have exclusive access to guns so they can kill all they want? How many unarmed people have to be killed in a "gun free zone" before you come to realize that mandating unarmed and helplessness will do nothing to save even a single life?
