Hi -
May be good :) for the 2 children, your husband is helping you to raise... But 
the child, whose life you ended before birth, you gave No-chance to; so 
what's this rationalization - only in 'your mind' - re "a 2nd. chance to make it right"??
See you recognized & admit caving-in to "dumb peer pressure" before then compounding acts of irresponsibility.
But your mother:
1. She was "ashamed" - was she selfishly more concerned with herself?, and what people would think of her?, and you? and the family? - so, let's just "Quietly kill it"?
and
2. She was "ready to kill me" - right: 'Kill ! this! baby!, before I kill you' - type-thing. great; that's a *lesson for Pro-life* not! emoticonXBanghead 
So your mother failed the *both of you*, bigtime! - and while you can't change that part of your past,
to a degree - much larger than you most likely realize, you are shaping your 2 current children's life. 
And from your rationalizations (about the baby you killed), the concern is that you  model soul/mindfully  for your children, good/honorable behavior. And you support them, in such choices...- so how are you *Interacting with..., Imprinting/Teaching* your 2 children now? - giving them a chance at 
making better :) choices, you realize...
