You revel in those beliefs, certainly - and not surprising either. All these miracles, and others, embody the personally comforting notion that for special people, the universe makes exceptions. This is a common feature of religions, from the oldest to the newest, ever since we were first intelligent enough to appreciate at a conscious level that there were things in the world we didn't understand and couldn't control and which didn't seem to care very much about us, like lightning or crocodiles. 
As members of a species who have evolved the habit of ingratiating ourselves with other, more powerful members by making the right sounds and employing properly deferential body language, the idea of being able to employ the same techniques to get the uncaring forces of nature on your side is a powerfully seductive one. Certainly it's more palatable than believing that sometimes the crocodile is already full when you happen to take a dip, and sometimes it is not.
Gotta go, back later.
