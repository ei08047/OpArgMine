Well, that's not exactly true.
I don't put absolute faith in the results of science, but I do trust that scientists are not lying.
They may be wrong, but I don't defend what they say to the death.
I don't have an absolute belief in what they have found or the conclusions they've drawn.
I tend to "believe" the big bang theory, but I have serious doubts as to its validity.
I think the ability to change your mind about things as they come is what makes it not faith.
Trusting scientists that they aren't lying doesn't mean that I have faith in what they say.
Faith is a really strong word.

Oh, I also realize what you are saying so I'll try to explain.
Scientists publish their results in journals.
Their methods and results are there for everyone to see.
All you and I have to do is go to a library that subscribes to the journal, or personally subscribe to it, and look up their work.
If you had a problem with what they did, you can do your own experiments to prove them wrong, or at least make your case why you think they are wrong.
Now, getting your results published is another can of worms.
But, anyway, you or I don't have to be published to redo the experiments ourselves, but that might take some money.
Anyway, all I'm saying is that once something is published, it's not written in stone.
It doesn't become infallible scripture.
People who read it, "believe" it (or not), based on their own knowledge of the subject. Results and conclusions are challenged all the time. Interpretations are modified all the time.
I really don't see what any of this has to do with Faith.
