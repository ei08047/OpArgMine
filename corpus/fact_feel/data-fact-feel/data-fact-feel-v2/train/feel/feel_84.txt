I believe organized religion increases ignorance and represses progress but I'll not infringe your right to believe what YOU want and attend whatever church YOU want. Placing arbitrary restraints on private behavior (or ideas or other's beliefs) based on personal religious beliefs flies in the face of everything this country stands for. And stop bringing up ANIMALS...animals are different from PEOPLE, even the bible got that right.
