Did I ever say I had proof of no god? I just said I have no proof of god. And I never even claimed anything close to the fact that there is no god. I said that there is no proof of a god and no proof of no god. The thing I pointed out was your double-standard. You don't believe in parallel universes because there is no proof, yet you believe in God. Where is your proof there and there not proof for parallel universes. If you want to know what I believe, I really believe that what happens after death is irrelevant. I'm going to live based on what I know. I know that I am alive (or think I am). I know how to live it to the fullest (and it doesn't involve church or praying). I will live the way I want to which is probably very similar to the way you live yours. I haven't killed anyone, I try not to lie, I don't steal. I have probably about the same morals you do, except for one thing. I don't derive these morals from the fact that if I don't live by them I will burn in hell. I live by them because I know they are the right thing to do. I will not live my life out of fear, I will live my life the best way I know how based on what I know. If there's a god, he shouldn't have a problem with how I'm living my life and if he does have a problem, I don't want to listen to him anyway.
