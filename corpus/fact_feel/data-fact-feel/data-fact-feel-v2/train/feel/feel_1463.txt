you've got to be kidding me. This has got to be one of the absolute dumbest things I have heard. You are truly one confused individual if you can't tell there's a distinct difference between a living thing and a nonliving thing -- that non-living things are missing something that living things have.... Just because this difference cannot be analyzed, measured or defined does not mean it's not there. You can't analyze or define your thought patterns, dreams, brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they aren't there. I think you've lost it -- You may very well belong in a mental facility.
