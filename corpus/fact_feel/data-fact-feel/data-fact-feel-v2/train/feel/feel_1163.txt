Well, that's what I was doing too :-)
This was something that flashed into my mind one morning and I ran with it, posting it almost immediately, working through it all as I was typing. It's not something I've spent months on previously and had all possibilities covered: I was wanting others to take a look and see if they found a gaping hole I overlooked.
I've gotten your (tentative) agreement, and no counters that actually refute my reasoning, so I may move on, using this as a premise for my next step in a larger 'logical argument'.
