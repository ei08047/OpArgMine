I dont think I have heard a more pathtic excuse for a long time.
All but a few of my colleagues could get into work during the very worst of the weather..why? because they didnt get paid otherwise.
There needs only be a tiny amount of snow for UK teachers to stay away in droves...what a joke!
Strangely enough when I went to school both the pupils and the teachers seem to manage to get to school in the snow.
