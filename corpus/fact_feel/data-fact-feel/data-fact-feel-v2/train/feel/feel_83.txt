Well, you are apparently admitting that I am correct in that we do not know for sure. What God has to do with it I do not know, because I did not bring that side of the debate up. My argument is purely of logic and philosophy.
Consider for a second that you are wrong, and that abortion really is the killing of thousands and thousands of people. Then is abortion a woman's right? Of course not. No one has the right to take a life for the sake of convenience (I'm not talking about aborting because the mother's life is at stake, for now just clear-cut convenience). So you commit a logical fallacy by assuming women have this right, because you assume that people are not being killed, while you provide zero hard evidence that this is the case. So, once again you are risking thousands and thousands of lives based on a hope.
