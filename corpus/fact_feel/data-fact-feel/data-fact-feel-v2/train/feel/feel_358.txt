I think it would be more valid to say "Whenever a decision does not go our way, the first reaction should not be turn AGAINST the courts ..."
And what other "method" is there for the minority who has the majority oppressing them?
Is the minority supposed to turn to "democracy" for protection?
Democracy was part of the reason they were being discriminated against in the first place!
