Sure. Bring on the free machineguns to every male of military service and the paper tape.
BTW are YOU going to clean your machinegun? You are going to have to own a machinegun in your home you know. Your going to be forced to keep your machinegun clean. Your going to be forced to learn to place head shots at 300 yards. Your going to be forced to keep ammo sealed by paper tape. Sure I do all that right now. I'd be happy to do that with a free machinegun and free ammo. Is that what YOU want? The government handing out free machineguns? Just checking if you want that. I want it. Give me a free machinegun. Give my friends who shoot at the range and shoot rifle matches, give them all free machineguns and free ammo. Bring it on.
