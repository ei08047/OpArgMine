Its very sad to me that we have to brake the bondage of religion. I thought we did that? I was wrong. We under siege, from something horrible. One thing this horror is not, it’s not from God.
Jesus could not follow fundamentalism, he couldn’t do it. Yet the monsters head rises again and so we must address the lies and twists this creature wants to chain us with. If we as nation are forced to obey this Dragon called fundamentalism; our children will be drinking blood and casting out demons from foreign lands all their lives.
Nothing is more terrible or sinful than a Dogmatic man thinking he is doing the will of a God. Families have sacrificed (and are) their Children and drank the cool aid of the false Prophets. 
We have no choice anymore. We can not allow 2000 year old texts to be a literal book of guidance for a country our fathers fought to keep free. Don’t give up your fight, use logic and literary knowledge to tear down their straw houses. Use their book. Read it once and see what it says. The concepts in it actually destroy it. It’s failures in logic are easily shown as even laughable. Only then can man kind God. Secularism allows for such liberty. Church and Church states never will.
