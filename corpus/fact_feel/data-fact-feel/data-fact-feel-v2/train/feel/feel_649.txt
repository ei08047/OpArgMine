Oh, I see now, you must pervert and completely redefine what animism is in order to apply it to your corruption of what christianity is according to the bible. I have accurately defined what animism is above in comparison to the Old and New Testament which it has nothing in common with. But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who doesn't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell.
BTW, your explanation above which I have posted in its entirety is nothing more than self indulgent gibberish. http://www.religion-cults.com/Ancien...sm/Animism.htm
