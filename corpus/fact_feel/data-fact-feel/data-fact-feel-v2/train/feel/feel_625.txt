So if a story in the bible is proven to be true, like the fact that there is enough water in the ice caps, and the atmosphere to cover the highest mountains, then these "myths" would become less rediculous? Or would there be a logical explanation other than a higher life form did it? Mayabe a crazy man built a big boat at the right time and happened to have two of each animal at the time? But that would be crazy talk. Wouldnt it?
