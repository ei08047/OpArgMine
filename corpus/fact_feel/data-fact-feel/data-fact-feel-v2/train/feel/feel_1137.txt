I am very sorry to hear that. And maybe I came off a little bias in my pastposts and now that I have really thought about my opinions and the way they have come off to people I know that it is not my place or any one elses to judge another. I guess some of need to clean our own backyard befor we look at our neighbors. Best of luck to you and your family.
