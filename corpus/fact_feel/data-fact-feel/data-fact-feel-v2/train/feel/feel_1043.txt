For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)
This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.
Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. 
They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.
