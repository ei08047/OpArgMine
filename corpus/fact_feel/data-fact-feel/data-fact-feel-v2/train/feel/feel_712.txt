Seriously? Well, I come here hoping for something resembling an intelligent discussion. Every once in a while I get one. Most of the time it's just ramblings like Benjamin's here. I was kind of hoping that by ignoring the trolls the stupid to interesting ratio might go down. Do you really enjoy the kind of "debates" that posts like this inevitably start?
