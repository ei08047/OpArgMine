Forest for the freakin' trees.
So when heterosexual couples divorce, it's all automatic and assumed. Gay and straight people alike help foot the bill.
Straight couples "have abso-freaking-lutely no qualms about forcing Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer to pony up more dough"...
But when it comes to homosexual couples divorcing, it's only the gay individuals who "shell out more $$$".
Can you explain why it's just for gays to help pay for the divorce of straight couples, but the same is not done for gays??? emoticonXEmbarrassed
