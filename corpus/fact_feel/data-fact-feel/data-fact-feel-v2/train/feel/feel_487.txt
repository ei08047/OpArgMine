I bet you can not show one piece of objective evidence for any supreme being what so ever without resorting to lies, distoritions or plain ignorance.
Also, many of those scientists doing the work you are ignoring are probably not atheists at all. You seem to be assuming that. Since you are making the claim these scientists are 'atheists', I want you to demonstrate that they are.
