First off, all equally arbitrary doesn't mean they are all valid. If I made a mistake let me clear that up now :)
Secondly, you still have an arbitrary system going there. The idea that many people believe something doesn't make it true. Furthermore, your observations still make several assumptions that in fact are proclamations. Obviously people have come to observe different things from you...all of which can't be proven (in the sense we mean it) and all of which are abitrary.
