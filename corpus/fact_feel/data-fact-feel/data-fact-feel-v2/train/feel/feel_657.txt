You mentioned him once or twice. I could give a rats a$$ about him. My concern is for you or anyone else who is in your situation. If you end up getting shot, as you walk towards that light remember you had ample opportunity to have prevented the dire mess you may find yourself in! It was not the guns fault, heck it really was not your brothers fault... It would have been your fault because you failed to act. This line has nothing to do with my position on guns or trying to get a "one up" on the debate. You are in a dire LIFE THREATENING emergency much worse than me owning every mortar, grenade, f16, m16, ak-47 in the world. Do you get it?
