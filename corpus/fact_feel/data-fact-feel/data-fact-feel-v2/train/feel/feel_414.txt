Again, if it were only that simple.
I don't have the "obligation to respect the choices" of those who infringe upon the rights of another. Rapists make a "choice." Murderers make a choice, molesters make a choice... Are you "obligated to respect their choices," Chester?
Maybe in the sense that they are free to make "choices." You are.
On that we will agree. 
But I expect we don't always agree on what the consequences should be for some of the choices people make.
