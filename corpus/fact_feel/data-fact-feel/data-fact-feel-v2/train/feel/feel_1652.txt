Much used and abused argument. Can't really be proven or disproven until it is tested, so I am not sure there is an argument. This is dramaticized by Hollywood leftists in movies and TV, so it has become this seemingly powerful point. Still not seeing where millions of children should be punished for the likely much fewer women who will seek abortion if it is made illegal.
