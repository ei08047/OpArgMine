I know what your "point" was.
I also know what you ACTUALLY ASKED originally.
You asked: "Hey hypocrite, have you asked yourself how many millions of dollars every single pro-gay church spends each year promoting homosexual causes, including gay marriage and lobbying federal and State Governments directly in support of homosexual causes?
I think we're still waiting on an answer...
