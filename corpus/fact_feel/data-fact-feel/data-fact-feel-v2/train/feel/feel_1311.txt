Actually it seems you are the one that is sick. You have this obsession with what others do with their sex life and want the government to try and prevent any kind of sex you don’t approve of. It looks like you are trying hard to repress homosexual desires you have. Otherwise why do you care what others do when it doesn’t affect you?
I'm not for or against what other adults do with their consentual sex life. It's none of my business.
