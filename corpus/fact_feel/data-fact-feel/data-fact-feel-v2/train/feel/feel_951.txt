This is a poor poor analogy. Abortion is dealing with the decision to end another's life in order to sustain a preferred lifestyle. 
I think you may have been better off putting it this way. 
Say you dont drive drunk (personally against it for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drive drunk if they so choose. So, you are personally against drunk driving but you are "pro-choice" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves). Therefore there should be no laws preventing it and no punishment for the sad results. 
Pro-life would be: You don't drive drunk (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure no one else is able to either.
