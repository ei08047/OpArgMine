well, based on this argument, why shouldnt we kill mute, paralysed, vegetable, comatose, and very very drunk people, since they all cant think, or if they can they cant communicate that they are thinking. How about new-born babies that dont know anything? how about retarded children?
you are fooling yourself if you think that women undergo abortions because they dont like that particular "part of their body". women undergo abortions because they dont want to raise the child when its born. until you face that truth, you'll be arguing under a dellusion
