You're telling us we're soft on crime? You're the one who is portraying the two men who were shot as victims and dismissing their crimes.
It's ironic, those two criminals who cross the border illegally with malevolent intentions, robbed a guys house, and were legally killed are poor, innocent victims, yet this 80 year old man who just tried to defend himself and didn't hurt anybody is a mothertrucking, baby-eating criminal who deserves to be locked up.
You have such a distorted view of right and wrong, Brady.
