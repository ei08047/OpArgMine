You have a lot of choices. My wife had an abortion before we met. My mother also had an abortion when I was about 8. They both have regretted it greatly. Have you considered adoption? There are many many many great couples who cannot have babies that would love to have one and some companies can set you up with those that are willing to pay for the doctors fees and hospital fees etc.
This is indeed traumatic and a difficult choice. It is one I do not wish on anyone. I hope you know some folks you can trust to guide you and to lean on regardless of your decision.
You can still keep it, even though it will be hard, giving life is a wonderful thing.
I would suggest that you consider all angles. Talk with those that lead you both ways. Be wary of anyone who just confirms whatever you say. They are not likely giving you sound wisdom but just want you to like them. Pay attention to those that are secure enough in your relationship with them to speak openly and honestly to you. They may confirm your thoughts they may deny them.
Good luck.
