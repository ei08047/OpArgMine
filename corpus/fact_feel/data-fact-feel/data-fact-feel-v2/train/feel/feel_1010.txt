I am sure you meant "mediate" instead of "medicate" ? Or, is OSU a medical school? Or, did you know the man was off his meds? Exactly what does your rant mean other than you are so frustrated if you hear of a shooting in a Republic of over 3 million it drives you batty? How many kids drowned in 5 gallon buckets between your two posts? How many in car wrecks? How many from blunt objects or knives? Actually, death by guns is far down the list so why is it you go bananas when you hear of a shooting even if someone is killed or not? You do understand there are justifiable shootings also?
