so what about the idea, though, that if I move into a new location and my subconscious mind generates a new physical trait to adapt me to the situation. In this way my mere thoughts (non-physical) would be creating a new physical body...aka, getting something from nothing -- pulling a rabbit out of a hat. (I can show you numerous examples of this in the animal kindom if you wish.)
Also, what about non-locality. I could post some some weird stuff from physics...any of that count? I'm trying to pin down what is considered "miracle." And why does God have to be involved in a "miracle" anyway?...what if I were to believe that since humans were created in the image of God that we are all capable (or at least have the capacity) of performing our own miracles?
