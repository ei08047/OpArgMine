Ok, so you are admitting that the unborn fetus, is in fact, a child? I have to believe that is what you mean from your statement above. That being the case, do you condone the killing of a child that is born but will likely live in poverty the rest of his or her life? Do you condone the killing of a handicapped child that is born? If not, then you can't condone abortion. Also, who gives you the right to decide what is best for a child by killing him or her? That should not be your choice (this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air). I am sure the child wouldn't agree to that choice if given a voice to do so. 
Let's go ahead and do it your way by taking religion out of law. Is murder still illegal in your humanistic world? Likely it is still illegal because even humanists realize that anarchy is not suitable for society. Then why is this not murder? Look back to effects this has on women. That is also bad for society. And that affects us all.
