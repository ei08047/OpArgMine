Why is it you assume I'm doing nothing about it? Do you know how many charities I support which serve in Africa? The question is, what are you doing about it since it is only you whom you have complete control of. Think about actually contributing to programs like Doctors without borders rather than question my giving when it has already been proven on multiple threads that it is conservatives who contribute the lions share to charities in this country. All the liberals do is whine, complain and raise taxes so someone else will have to support their pet programs.
