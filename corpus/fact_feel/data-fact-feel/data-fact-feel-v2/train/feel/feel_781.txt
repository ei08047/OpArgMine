But not a legitimate concern in this case. I have never seen anyone show in any way that the Massachusetts court ruled incorrectly or abused their powers in the least. They based their ruling on their state constitution, which is exactly what they're supposed to do. "fiat" is simply a red flag to wave around to scare up some negative emotions.
