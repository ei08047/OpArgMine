So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.
You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.
So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?
