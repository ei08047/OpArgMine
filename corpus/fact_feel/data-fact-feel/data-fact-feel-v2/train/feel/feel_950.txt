I think there's a few points to be made here -
1) This is a forum specifically for the purpose of discussing God and religion. Thousands, hundred's of thousands, maybe even billions of people who don't believe in God haven't bothered to seek it out, they have no interest, it attracts those that do have an interest in learning how and why others think and do as they do.
2) Discussing something, no matter what the reason or how much it is discussed, does not lend any validity to what is being discussed. There is an infinite number of examples I could give to illustrate that point. Take in a sci-fi convention some time as a prime example.
3) I don't see so much the discussion of "is there a God/isn't there a God", as I do the discussion of religion and the Bible. That is a very important distinction. Religion is very real, and affects all of us, whether we are believers in it or not. Whether or not Bigfoot exists, or the Klingons are invading someone, has no bearing whatsoever on my life or reality, religion does. I think that is the reason you see such fervent discussion and rejection of Christianity on forums like this. Why the large outcry? Those in the minority always tend to be more vocal, they have to be, or they'd simply be overwhelmed by the "silent" majority.

P.S. Don't sell yourself short, you more than hold your own on these forums.
