OH MY GOD!!! I JUST REALIZED ... I'M TO BLAME!
My letter to the editor was printed in Sunday's newspaper and Sunday night the storms started hitting the south! That cannot be coincidence. God has lifted his protecting hand because of my letter.
But seriously, 3 people I ran into today told me they saw it. Two were people at work: one just said she read it without saying how she felt about it, the other went a bit farther to say that it really didn't offend her. But if you think about it, just her comment indicates that she felt that the way most people would respond would be negatively. The other person was my dentist, who I just happened to have an appointment with today. He starting talking at great length about Hugh Ross, and Gerald Shroeder, and how his own personal faith in Jesus and science get along just fine. I listened for about 15 minutes, only saying a few things now and then. And when I did, I didn't argue against his position ... I just pointed out that people really have to accept that evolution is true and that the Earth is billions of years old, which he had already said he accepted.
