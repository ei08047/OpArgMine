let me try to translate into words
1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds
2. there being a god is a possibility
3. If there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one
4. There not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)
5. There is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds
6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world
7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds
8. There's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.
9. Since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world> is false.
10. Since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3
Is this the right interpretation? If it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.
