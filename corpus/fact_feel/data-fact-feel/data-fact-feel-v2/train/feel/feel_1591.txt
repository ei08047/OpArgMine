Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. 
My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say "Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this..."
But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?
