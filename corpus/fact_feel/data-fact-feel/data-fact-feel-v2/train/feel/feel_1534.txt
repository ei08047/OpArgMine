Gennipher,
1. In regard to your friends' actions...do you agree with abortion being a last resort "birth control" when contraceptives or humans fail?
2. Why does being against abortion exclude one from being against the starvation and hunger of children?
Matthew 19:14  "...Jesus said, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
