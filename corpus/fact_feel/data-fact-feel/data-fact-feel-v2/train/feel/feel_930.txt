First you yourself make a baseless comment saying "the amount of illegal abortions was not that many" then you suggest I need to disprove some baseless comment you previously made.
I'm afraid I do not. As I said I try to take a world view -- America is a small place compared to the entire world.
My comments are never reffering to America specifically unless I specify otherwise; I don't even live in America so it grates slighlty that I should have to make this point.
