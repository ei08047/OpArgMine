Oh good grief!
I have always lived in rough areas. In one city, Alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.
Where I worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.
I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER, I didn't know the stupid beast, I was scared to death, but I felt it my Christian duty (even though I am not a Christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.
And I don't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted.
