Also, how do we "know" that the heat generated in these reactors is from so-called "nuclear fission" and not a heavenly gift to allow us our god-given right to toasters and ipods. The scientists had funny foreign names, so they are likely non-christian terrorists who hate freedom. Anyway, this nucular physics stuff is just another religion.
