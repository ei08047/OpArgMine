Really?
She was taken to two different hospitals and an ICU, and she still died? Health care has nothing to do with it. This seems like a desperate cry to change, but not unfair government work. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE REGARDLESS! This had nothing to do with being treated unfairly, but it had everything to do with a sob case that was misstated, and uncharged. It doesn't make sense, and unless it's changed, I don't think that it ever will.
