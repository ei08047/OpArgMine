I see that you fail to see the logic that the less dominant Siamese twin ALSO has a right to their own body. One is not supporting the other - they are supporting each other so their rights are equal. Besides, both have a mental existence so, at least for me, abortion (or, in this case, one being killed for the rights to body of the other) would not be allowed.
