And what does stop you? You could decide that for yourself. But that wouldn't make the action just or moral. That action would still hurt people, and it would still be evil.
So perhaps I should ask, if God were not threatening religious people with Hell, would they still be good people? Or are all of the selfless and generous actions of religious people stemmed from the selfish desire to get into heaven? If they are not stemmed from their own selfish desire to enter heaven, then they are they not rooted in that individual's own desire to help others. This exists in some people.
For those in whom it does not exist, we have the law. We create governments to do that which is in our best interest and that which is in our best interest is that which helps everyone. For that which harms someone else might soon be that which harms us.
I have oversimplified what is a very complex understanding of morality, but the point is that the morality of an atheist does not begin with the desire to enter heaven, it begins with the desire to help others or create a society which will help everyone.
