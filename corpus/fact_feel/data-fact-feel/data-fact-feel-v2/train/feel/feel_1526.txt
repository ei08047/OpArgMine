While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a "second chance". I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance.
I probably shouldn't say "you" because it seems like you didn't have a choice in the matter. 
Anyway, thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums.
