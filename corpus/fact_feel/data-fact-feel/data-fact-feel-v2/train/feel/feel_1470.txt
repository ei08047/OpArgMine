More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.
