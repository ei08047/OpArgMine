Other posters on this thread have much greater knowledge in this area than I. I would like to drop the science briefly and address this very beginning of SS's post. One should always ask why people behave the way they do. Therefore this post raises some questions for me:


* Why would these "world's greatest minds" behave the way they do, continue working to keep the population "snow-blinded" (whatever that means)?
* Are all evolutionary scientists working in concert to achieve this ruse?
* If a motive exists, other than the pursuit of knowledge, does this extend to other scientists?
* Is all science a sham?
