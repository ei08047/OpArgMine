I think the history of discrimination against gays does count as oppression.
Being classified as a "mental illness" with cures that could possibly involve shock "therapy", castration, or lobotomies, having our sex be illegal, the type of harassment we have seen which should make any civilized person blush...
I understand you think the "oppression" could be worse, but quite frankly how many minority groups have undergone what gays have undergone? I mean, there is no competing with the atrocities committed against the blacks, and millions of Jews died in the holocaust (along with gay people), but what more is required before you can look at gay history and not see it as "oppression"?
