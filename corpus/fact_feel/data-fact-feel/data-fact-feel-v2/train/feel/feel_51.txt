And you're probably one of those kooks who thinks the colorado river carved the Grand Canyon over millions of years, right?
So tell me, how does the land erode in a place like this? (next link) There's nowhere for the sediment to go!...yet we have supposedly 65-90 million year-old creatures laying at or near the surface:

Not only that, but in the same area you'll also find humans and cows at the surface:

"Now what was a fossil cow skull doing in a place like this – an area rich in dinosaur bone more than 100 million years old?
More pieces of the puzzle were being picked up by other team members. Dave exclaimed gleefully, “Look, it’s human! Part of the skull!” as he held high the curved plate of bone that shields the massive human brain. He never expected to find fossil humans on a dinosaur expedition."
funny, isn't it, how the human and the dinosaur are at the surface! Shouldn't there be at different stratas? Shouldn't erosion have kicked in somewhere in between the death of the dinosaur and the death of the human, some 60 million years later?????
