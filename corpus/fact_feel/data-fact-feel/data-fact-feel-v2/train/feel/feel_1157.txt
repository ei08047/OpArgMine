Legalising them would increase use however. Most people can't get hard drugs easily. If they get hard drugs at all, it's still a lot harder to get hard drugs, than say alcohol.
Then there's the risk factor. Most people aren't willing to take that and risk becoming embroiled with dealers.
I don't particularly want an increase in hard drug use.
