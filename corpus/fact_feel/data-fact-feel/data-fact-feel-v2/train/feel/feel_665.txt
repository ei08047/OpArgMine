But what's best for society is usually best for me, and so I am not disqualified from this debate. That's why I keep pointing out why it would be a bad thing to enslave people or oppress people because it hurts everyone in the end. That's what causes wars and crime a lot of the time. So yeah, I do go with what's best for me, but why should I go with any other way?
If I was a fetus, well who knows what I'd think. That's a whole other debate that some other people have already gotten into but which I think is kind of pointless. My whole point is that we kill people every day whether you like it or not, so this whole right to life thing is nonsense. You may not be the one pulling the trigger, but you always contribute to deaths. But we try to select which deaths we cause so that those deaths will lead to the most happiness for everyone else. And I think that allowing abortion does lead to more happiness for society. And before you try to show me polls about abortion to prove that many people disagree with it, and so it causes them unhappiness, that's not the only thing I'm talking about. I'm talking about the unhappiness of the child born into an ungrateful family, the potential criminal problems, and all the other things that have already been mentioned. And yes, those are only potential problems, but that's how society works. We give people jobs based on their percieved potential, we admit people to college based on potential. You have to go with the odds, it's simply how life works.
