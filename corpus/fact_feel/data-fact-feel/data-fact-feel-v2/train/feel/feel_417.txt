I believe he was talking about the two ends of the spectrum of opinions on abortion. With that in mind, "minutes before birth" would refer to those people in the far corner who think that abortions should be allowed even minutes before birth. Obviously, that idea is a little too radical for most people and from my knowledge, it's illegal right now anyway.
Of course, this is just my interpretation, if you don't like it, then suck it up and wait for chaoticgnome to come back.
