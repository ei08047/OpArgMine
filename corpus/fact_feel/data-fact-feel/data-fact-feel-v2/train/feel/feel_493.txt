Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.
What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said "You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term." I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted.
