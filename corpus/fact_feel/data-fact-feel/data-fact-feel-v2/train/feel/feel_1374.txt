At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?
How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?
