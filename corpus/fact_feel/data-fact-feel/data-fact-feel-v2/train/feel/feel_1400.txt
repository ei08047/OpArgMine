Well I'm neither rational nor a theist, but still!
I could put in a comment about what I personally believe the nature of God to be, but I'm sure you've all heard it before so I won't bother!
In the end I don't think it is an easy question to answer, it is asking to define the undefinable. Humans are limited creatures, we can give a dictionary definition of these things, we have a rough idea of the concept of infinity but can never begin to truly comprehend or define it.
