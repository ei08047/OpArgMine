To be fair, my understanding is that Southern Baptists do now support black civil rights as an organization. Churches are much more loosely affiliated with it than in other denominations, so the denomination can't really control what individual churches do which are southern Baptist in name. That's what I've read; maybe someone who IS southern baptist would better know.
