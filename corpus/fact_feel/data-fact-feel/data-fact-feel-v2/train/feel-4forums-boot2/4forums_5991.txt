Utter nonsense! Obama is not much of a leftist. And Kerry and Kennedy either married wealth or inherited it. Edwards earned his wealth. And, I don't believe that any of those individuals believe that they should pile up any more wealth at the expense of others.  John McCain, on the other hand.... And, as for Bush/Cheney?
