A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to  win  an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of  reasoning  has the following form:  1. Topic A is under discussion.  2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when  topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).  3. Topic A is abandoned.
