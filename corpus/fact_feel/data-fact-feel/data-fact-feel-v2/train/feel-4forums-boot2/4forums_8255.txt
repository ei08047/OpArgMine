He he, I guess I would definitely consider myself a weed addict.  Although, the addiction is more psychological than physical.  If you smoke weed all the time and then stop for a week or so, you get really pissy and irritable, but that's about it.  But no regular pot smoker sits around justifying why they do it, they just do it cuz they like it, nothing too complicated about it.
