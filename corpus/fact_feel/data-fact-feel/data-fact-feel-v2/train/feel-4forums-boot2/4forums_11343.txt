Only a fool would deny the validity of Geology in legitimate science. Just as only a fool would deny the bible answers our questions in spiritual matters, such as how did we get here. But to apply Geology to a false science such as evo is to corrupt it and will no doubt be proven to result in false conclussions ln many areas of its application.  So much for this thread that was started in order to bait and mock rather than seek to learn or actually teach anything.
