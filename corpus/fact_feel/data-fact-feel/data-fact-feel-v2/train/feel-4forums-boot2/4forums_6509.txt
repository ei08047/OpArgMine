In my opinion, any man who walks away from his child because he doesnt want the responsibility he helped to create, is not a real man in my book. I just simply feel like if I got a woman pregnant, unless she is in eminant danger from the pregnancy, that I should have just as much of a legal right as she does pertaining to an abortion. I personally would love to have some kids, so i would never walk away from my child.
