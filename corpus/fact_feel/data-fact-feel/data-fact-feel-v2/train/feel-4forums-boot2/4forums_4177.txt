Are you incapable of reading, as well as being mind-numbingly assinine? The thread is about creationism, not evolution. Attacking evolution does not defend the lies of creationists. Your failure to defend biblical creation shows that you cannot support your own position and instead have to resort to petty nit-picking of your opponent's position. This is both stupid and intellectually dishonest.
