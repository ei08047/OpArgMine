Hello there,  Your ignorance is showing concerning both history and anthropology.  We Neanderthals were the first humans to recognize the existence of the soul and the afterlife. We were the first to bury our beloved dead with personal articles, still valuable and quite usable to the living, but because they belonged to those we loved, we buried such items with them.  You obviously were never taught that and never sharp enough to learn for yourself, but hey, that's nothing new from someone from the Left.  Symbol over substance is your mantra and shall no doubt, so remain.  Cheers from the Rockies
