Actually, I have a better idea. We're getting all out of sync with our replies and it's going to get messy - my fault, I introduced too much ground to cover in my OP. Pick a subtopic - say the interpretation of fossil evidence, or the plausibility of common ancestry between chimps and humans given their modern forms and lifestyles, and we'll focus on that. The other points we've raised and challenged, we can put on hold and refer back to later.
