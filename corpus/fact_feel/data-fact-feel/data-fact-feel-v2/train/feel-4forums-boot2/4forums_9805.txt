You praise my former country's health care plan, championing it over anything else America might have...and you don't even know whether or not they get sick pay from work?  First you praise Canada's system, even though it only applies to Canadian citizens and it's a three year wait to become nationalized. And now you're praising Britain and you don't get sick leave over there.
