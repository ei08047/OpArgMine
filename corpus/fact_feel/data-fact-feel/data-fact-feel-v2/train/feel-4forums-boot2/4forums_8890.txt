You hit the nail on the head there. Go to a shooting range or gun shop some time, and ask who of them is willing to pull their gun and start shooting at the slightest provocation. If someone is stealing my car, I am not going to shoot them over it. Even if I had the loaded gun in my hand. If someone is threating em or someone else, they are getting at least one wherever i find it convenient. Maybe if the media would stop bothering everyone with how dangerous assualt weapons are, people could learn the facts. Again, go into any guns hop. Ask which is deadlier, a .223 fired out of an 'Assault weapon' or the Garand chambered in .30-06 sitting next to it.
