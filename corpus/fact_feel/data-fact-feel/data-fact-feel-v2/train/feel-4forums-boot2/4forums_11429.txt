What would be the opposition to making 2nd, 3rd, and partial birth abortions illegal with exceptions involving  life and death  issues of the mother?  It seems to me that all others matters could be sorted out before the 1st trimester is complete.  If this were a viable option how many abortions would actually be prevented??
