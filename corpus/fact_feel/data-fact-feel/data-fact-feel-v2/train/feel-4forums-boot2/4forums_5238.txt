Actually, I think Iran is doing it to produce nuclear weapons.  Why? Because Bush sent a message post 9/11 that if you have a nuke, America won't bother you.  Think about it, if the world's superpower has a pattern of letting those with nukes do what they want, why wouldn't you want to get one as soon as you can?  Whatt??? All this time, I thought Bush wanted to dethrone Saddam Hussein and stop his weapons of mass destruction--didn't that include nukes??  And when did Bush every say that if someone has a nuke, America won't bother you?  Your whole post is unfounded.
