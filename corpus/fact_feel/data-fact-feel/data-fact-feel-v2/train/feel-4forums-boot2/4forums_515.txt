For those that argue over the pretense of  marriage is a religious institution , I don't know why they don't push SOLELY for what governmental involvement of  civil unions .  After all, if the government has a hand in the institution of marriage, it's not just a  religious institution .  Moreover, those fighting against gay marriage are doing so SOLELY in the governmental arena. If a gay couple gets married in their church, that's entirely legal in 50 states with no attempts to make it illegal.  So it kind of undermines the pretense of  religious  concerns when people SOLELY try to prevent GOVERNMENTAL recognition of gay unions.
