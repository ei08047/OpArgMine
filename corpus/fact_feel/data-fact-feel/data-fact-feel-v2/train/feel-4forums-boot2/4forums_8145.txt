If freeing slaves meant that the former slaves could live of other's organs without their desire or consent, putting their health and possibly life at risk... while at the same time having no perception of self, no brain, no mind, no consciousness... I would side with the slaveowners.  Once anotherÂ’s right to live becomes greater than my right to my own body, I become the slave.
