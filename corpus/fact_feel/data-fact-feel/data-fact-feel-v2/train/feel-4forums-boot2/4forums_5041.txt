Atheism is a lack of belief. Does a lack of belief in gremlins make a person an agremlinist? Is agreminlism a religion? Is ateakettleinorbitism a religion? If I maintained a  doctrine or belief that there is no omni-everything Invisible Pink Unicorn (mhhnbs),  is that a religion, too? If so, can I get tax-exempt status?  You know how the saying goes: If atheism is a religion, then bald is a hair color.
