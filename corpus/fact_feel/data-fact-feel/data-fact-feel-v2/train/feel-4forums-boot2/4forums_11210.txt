Police are a reactionary force. Most effective in traffic control and revenue collection.  Police do not have the ability to be where gun related crimes occur. They do not have ESP. Most Americans live many miles from any source of aid. Either in rural or suburban areas. City dwellers have officers in their vicinity but officers are hampered by crowds and traffic. Your assessment of rights versus duty is correct. But if we want to be safe, we should assume the duty.
