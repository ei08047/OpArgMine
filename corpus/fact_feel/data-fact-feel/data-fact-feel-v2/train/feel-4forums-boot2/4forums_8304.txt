Bigots will be bigots. The parents oblivious to their heterosexual privledge. You are right they would never have objected to a story of a prince and princess getting married. The double standard is outragious and an example of their heterosexual privledge.  I don't have a problem with removing all gay issues from the schools as long all heterosexual issues are also removed. So what are these parents that protested this book reading going to teach thier children about gay families?
