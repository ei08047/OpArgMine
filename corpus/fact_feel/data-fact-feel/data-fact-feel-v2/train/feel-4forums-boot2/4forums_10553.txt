A text as a source for an experiment doesn?t do me much good. What I need to validate and research it is; who preformed the experiment (the institution would be helpful too) and when the experiment was done (that information should be available in the text).  I remember having a discussion with a physician friend of mine. He had introduced a similar experiment as support, but as it turned out it was uncertain that one of the three plants as actually a separate species. I am not insinuating that this is the same experiment as I don?t remember the particulars (although I do remember the experiment had something to do with cannabis).
