Well, many argue that pro gay rights is a conservative. They say that conservatives favor government staying out of people's lives and not dictating the way that people should live. They argue that conservative people are using religion, not conservative principle to stand against gay rights. I don't know if that is true; I do know that whether conservative, liberal, both, or neither, I cannot find a way to call myself a good person if I do not support gay rights.
