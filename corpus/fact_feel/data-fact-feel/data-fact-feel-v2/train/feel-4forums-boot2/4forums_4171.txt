Anyone think it's incredible that the Griffin Vulture can fly at 36,955.381 feet and still breathe ? And can we even relate to the amount of energy expended to fly, or the amount of oxygen needed to sustain such a flight ? We can't do it without pressurized cabins yet they do it in the natural course of traveling.
