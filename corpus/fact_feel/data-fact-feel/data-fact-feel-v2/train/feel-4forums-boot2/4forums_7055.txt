The thing I am trying to get at is that there wouldn't be a  you  left to have any concern if all of your mental processes were gone and all that was left was the living body sustained artificially. It comes down to the question of when we as people begin and end our existence. From previous posts, it seemed like you agree that mental existence is crucial, but I wasn't sure, given your responses on this thread.  So, do you or don't you agree that mental existence is crucial to our existence as people?
