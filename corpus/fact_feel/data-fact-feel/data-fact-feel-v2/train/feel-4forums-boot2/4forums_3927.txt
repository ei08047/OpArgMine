GET A CLUE.  Climate change will mean an AVERAGE rise in temperature, not that we never get cold weather. Compare the current cold conditions in Britain with the winters that regularly occurred in the 40s and 50s. If anything, some climate models predict more of this sort of weather in western Europe due to the weakening of the Gulf Stream.
