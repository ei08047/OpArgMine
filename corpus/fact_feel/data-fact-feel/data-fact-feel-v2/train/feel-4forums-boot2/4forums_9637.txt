Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as  assault weapons  are  inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip . Which is it?  Prove it then.  Then you've got absolutely no justification for supporting gun control, you should be supporting criminal control instead.  Then why do you keep supporting laws that would restrict access to guns, rather than making it harder for violent offenders to get out of prison and back on the streets where they pose the greatest danger?  Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?
