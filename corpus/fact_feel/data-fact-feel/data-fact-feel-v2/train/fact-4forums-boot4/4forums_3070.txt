I know a number of Christians who do actually stick to this belief.  And this one too (abeit watered down- having to wear a to church)  Goes to show just when you thought we had gone all progressive there are some people wanting hiding blatant sexism behind the veil of religion.  But with regard to your point I agree entirely- the bible is interpreted in different ways, depending on the person.
