Yes, but when the second amendment came out there was no  national guard.  So that didn't mean just the militia. Also if you notice it says there   2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of  the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the  Naval Militia.   So it can be anyone else capable of taking up arms.
