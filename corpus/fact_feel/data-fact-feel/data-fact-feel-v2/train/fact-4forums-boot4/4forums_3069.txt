Any surgery that is needed for life threatening illness are taken care of ASAP. None life threatening, but life quality illnesses are the one that take time. Hip and knee replacements Life quality. Cancer life threatening.  Now, if I am not mistaken, a poorer person without health care coverage in the US would never recieve a hip replacement operation? Or am I wrong?
