No, our Constitution doesn't really  forbid  it, what it does forbid is the government from forming a  state  religion. This has been interpreted to the benefit of all, to also mean that our laws cannot represent one specific religious belief system.  Granted, I do agree that a religious argument in terms of law is like comparring apples to a chair.
