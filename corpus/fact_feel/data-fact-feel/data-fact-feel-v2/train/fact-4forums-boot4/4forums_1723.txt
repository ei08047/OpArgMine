I was unaware of specific instances because my daughters are 29 and 30 years old respectively and not in the fifth grade like the parent who reported this issue. But I wouldn't be so coy as to not provide evidence that these things are happening in other public school systems in other states as well as in mine. Here ya go, read it and weep you parents of young children. And prepare yourself for the ranting and raving of these homosexual apologists who will deny and/or ignore the realities of what the gay agenda is doing to indoctrinate our children as young as is humanly possible. Horror stories in your schools  Not real enough for you? Listen to actual recordings of teachers teaching this stuff to 14 year olds.  http://www.massresistance.org/docs/i...te/tape01.html  http://www.massresistance.org/docs/i...te/tape02.html
