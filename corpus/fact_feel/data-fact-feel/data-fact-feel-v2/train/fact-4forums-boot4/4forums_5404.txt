Holland hasn't legalised, its decriminalized. This allows drugs to remain in the hands of the dealers, keeping prices high. We need full legalization.  The quantity of alcohol use rose during the Prohibition. Not proof that legalising drugs would cut use, but certainly a reason not to assume they'd rocket.
