Yes and no  Yes and no  Yes and no  All are saved as there is no hell  Would you kill or burn your child if they did these things? what part of unconditional love and love without end do you not understand?  Faith is enough  That just it you don't have to do anything. Grace can not be given or taken away by anything you do or don't do.  And he said,  Let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  A secret that my daddy said was just between us.   He said,  Daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.   --- George Straight
