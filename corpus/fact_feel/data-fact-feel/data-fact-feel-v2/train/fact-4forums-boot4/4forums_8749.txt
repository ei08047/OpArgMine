lol, therere lot of  disorders  that dont prevent people from doing anything. if being blind is a disorder should they disallow blind people from getting married?  other than that, you'd be hard-pressed to classify  being gay  as a disorder  but in any event, just classifying something as a disorder is hardly every good grounds to disallow it. look up affirmative action (im black, by the way, just in case eyebrows start raising)
