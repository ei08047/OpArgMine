Cannot be demostrated? What? The very fact that it is called the Theory of Evolution suggests that it is scientific by nature.   Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary. Theories are made up of people who believe in something based on logic and much consideration with all evidence taken into account. Theories more closely resemble facts than they do religion IMO.
