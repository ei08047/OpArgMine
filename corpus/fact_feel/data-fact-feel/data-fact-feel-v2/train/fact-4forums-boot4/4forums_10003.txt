Okay.  The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular:  We make an observation about what we see.  We form a hypothesis based on our observation.  We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis.  We make an observation about what we see (in the experiment).  Rinse and repeat...  Now add a spur: after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses, a theory is devised.
