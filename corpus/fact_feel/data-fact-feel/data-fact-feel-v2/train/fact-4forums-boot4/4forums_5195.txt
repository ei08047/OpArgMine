Let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment. The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us. It may seem like we don't need that now but one day it really might come in handy and people shouldn't forget that.  I still think incorporation is a load of BS though...for any amendment. Damn you 14th amendment!
