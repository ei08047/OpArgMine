Well, criticism of your opinions isn't hard to find here. What is interesting is that you rarely have anything substantial against those criticisms. After all, you said that bees cannot fly, tv show props are good evidence of creationism, and that oil is not a hydrocarbon.  Your opinion does not count for much given its consistent history of massive and epic levels of incorrectness.  Interesting how you think that because we arouse through natural processes we don't have any more value than anything else that arouse through natural processes. Sterile sand is natural. So is uranium. Tell me, which is more valuable?
