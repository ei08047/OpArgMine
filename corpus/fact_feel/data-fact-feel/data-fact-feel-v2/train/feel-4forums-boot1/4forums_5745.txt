REALLY?  let me reword it for the simple people ...  If you are old enough to decide to die in the military for YOUR COUNTRY - you are old enough and mature enough to reasonably care for fire arms properly.  IF you can LEGALLY join the military (as in not a traitor or a criminal) you should ALSO be allowed to own any weapon you can personally purchase.  QUESTION: Are you a MODERATE or really pro FREEDOM?  with an attitude like yours - you MUST be a friggin wishy washy moderate!
