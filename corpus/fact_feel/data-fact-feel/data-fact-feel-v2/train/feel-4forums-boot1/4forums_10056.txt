OK. Marriage. Originally it was always between man and woman. Why is it all of a sudden changing? Sure you can have a relationship, that's not the main thing that bothers me. Marriage also consists of a nifty little tax break. I'm sorry, but I don't want to pay for that. I think the initial break was there to help raise a family. Until homosexual couples can have children, I don't want to fork that out of my paycheck.  They can legalize these marriages for all I care, but I'm not paying for them, and I'm sure other's don't want to either.  Also, homosexual has all of a sudden started to grow at an alarming rate. It's more than it used to be, and I don't think genetics have anything to do with it. It's learned. So if we keep teaching everyone that it's fine, then sure, we'll have more homosexuals. That's beside the point though.  Why are we all of a sudden questioning the definition of marriage? 50 years ago, no one would have thought otherwise. Man and Woman.  There are moral reasons (which I won't go into) but there are also scientifical reasons.  Others may disagree with me here
