Without a regular supply of naive, incoherent, or asinine posters prepared to deny even the most well established scientific hypotheses, laws of physics, etc., other interested parties (e.g. the casual readers) would not get a chance to how scientific method and rational arguments are deployed to answer and refute nonsense. For this reason, the  fruit and nutters  should not be completely discouraged.
