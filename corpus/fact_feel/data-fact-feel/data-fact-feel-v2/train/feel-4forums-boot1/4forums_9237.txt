So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?  Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.  Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?  Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume  armed citizens  would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not.
