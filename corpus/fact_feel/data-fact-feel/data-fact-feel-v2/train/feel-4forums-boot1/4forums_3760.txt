SoC,  Abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children.  Would you, then, REALLY prefer that some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat control the future of a woman's pregnancy instead of the woman herself?  If so, what penalty would you have the government impose on a woman and her physician if they committed what you must believe is the  crime  of terminating her pregnancy?  BTW, hve you put your money where your mouth is by going to a pregnant woman and saying to her,  I will adopt your child and provide it with the love, discipline, and money needed to have it become a productive member of our society. , or, like so many profetallifers, does your concern stop at birth?
