Well ... that does tend to happen when you waste time arguing the obvious as if it were a rebuttal to anything. Maybe rather than being argumentative to the point of arguing over things that are pointless and that no one disagrees on, you could thoughtfully discuss things that people don't see eye to eye on. You might get better results from people that way.
