Since this commentary on a study is by an anti-choicer site, I take everything in it with a grain of salt. I'll have to look into the actual article and post again when I don't have to read all of their spin garbage.  I'll post later after reviewing the study, but as of right now, did you maybe, just maybe think this  connection  between abuse and abortion is due to the woman not wanting to bring a child into the world to be abused? That she doesn't want someone else to experience the abusive situation she is in? I know that's expecting a lot out of you, but just put in the effort to use your brain, and you might be suprised at what you discover.  Use some common sense, people, rather than parroting anti-choice rhetoric.  Edit: The actual study thing is here in case anyone wants to read the actual science rather than the garbage posted here. Just a cursory glance shows that the garbage they spewed (especially from that abortionfacts.com thing) has no basis in fact.
