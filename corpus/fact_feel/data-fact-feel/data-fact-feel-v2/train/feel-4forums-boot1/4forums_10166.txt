Well, you've told me you do not believe, literally, in the book of genesis. God didn't create the world in six days, the earth and the rest of the universe are actually billions of years old, etc.  But I assume you do believe, literally, in the ten commandments? That they are really the words of god?  Why the dichotomy? How can you write the creation story of as something to interpret as you wish, but the ten commandments are solid and correct?
