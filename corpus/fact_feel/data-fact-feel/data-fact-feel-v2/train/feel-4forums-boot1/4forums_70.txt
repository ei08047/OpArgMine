You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.  As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes.
