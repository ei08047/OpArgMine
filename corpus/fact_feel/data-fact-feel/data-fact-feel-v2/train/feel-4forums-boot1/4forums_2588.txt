There is or ought to be a clear distinction between free speech and harrasment. There is a right to speak ones mind but no right to be heard. There is no right to harrass but stating an opinion, even if rudely, does not not constitute harrasment. Simply ignore what you don't wish to see or hear and you will be fine.
