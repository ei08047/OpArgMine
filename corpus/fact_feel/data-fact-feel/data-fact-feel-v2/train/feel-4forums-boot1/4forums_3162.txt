You are welcome to your faith, and you can use it to believe whatever you like, but this continuing misconception of yours that (on the subject of evolution) we're exchanging beliefs and opinions of equal merit can only be counterproductive. Evidence inevitably weighs in, and apart from a single chapter in a single book all of it is landing on my side. Either the whole world is lying to me, or that one chapter is allegorical, misinterpreted or just plain wrong. It does not require faith, bias or belief to be convinced when the evidence is overwhelming. You proudly proclaim you have the faith, the bias, necessary - that's fine; as I said you're welcome to it. But don't make the mistake of assuming everyone forms their opinions the same way.
