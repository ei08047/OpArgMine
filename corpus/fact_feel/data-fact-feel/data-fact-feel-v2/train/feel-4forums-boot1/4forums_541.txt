Actually, I think that lack of support for your mythology is one of the reasons that it isn't accepted as literal. I suspect that your documentation is just assertion that you believe because it tells you what you want to hear.  Why is it that creationists keep claining to have  proof  and never present any? Have you checked out the threads in the Religion forum where some posters are having trouble demonstrating the historicity of Jesus? How can you claim documentation for Adam &amp; Eve, the Garden, talking snake, the flood?
