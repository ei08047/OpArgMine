Let's research the quality of there Prisons, cells, food, routines, and the prison lifestyle that these lifers find so difficult to endure and copy it here so our lifers suffer the same depth of despair and hopelesness. Lifers shouldn't have access to TV, Radio, Newspapers, or even interaction with other Prisoners. They should be in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day with access only to the religious book of their choice if they want one. Life for a convicted murderer should be so hard that they pray for death over living like that.  But coming from the Italian Prisoners, It's probably nothing more than reverse psychology to lay guilt on the Politicians for better living conditions.
