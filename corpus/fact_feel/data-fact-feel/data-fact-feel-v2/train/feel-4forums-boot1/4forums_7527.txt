Yes, and depending on how you define morality.  I'm not asserting that just law can be determined devoid of right or wrong. Just that law should not step every time something is immoral.  Do you? For example, I deduce from your posts that you perhaps see homosexuality as immoral. For you don't think same gender marriage should be allowed. However, I'll venture to guess -- and you can certainly correct me -- that you don't think homosexuality should be illegal. Even though you think it's immoral.
