Well we assume a right to your own body here. It is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history.  I guess I don't agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them...if this is the standard then we are all in trouble.
