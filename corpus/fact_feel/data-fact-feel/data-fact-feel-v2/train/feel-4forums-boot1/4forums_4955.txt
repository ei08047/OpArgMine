Oh? What keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest?  I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
