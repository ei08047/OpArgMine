Actually, a guy I talked to used a .40 S&amp;W UZI carbine for hunting deer in southern Florida. I also have some .mpgs of people using them in timed competitions, even with *gasp* silencers. FYI, you can still buy UZIs, you always could. They just can't be imported anymore. Want to buy one? Check these guys out: http://www.vectorarms.com/guns/UZI_Page.htm Are you still sure the AWB is preventing lunatics from going on shooting sprees in the streets? If so...  What did the AWB do? How about a little bit of  show and tell .  http://www.markii.org/images/aw.jpg
