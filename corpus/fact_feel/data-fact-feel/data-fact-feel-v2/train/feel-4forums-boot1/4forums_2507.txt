So is it immoral to kill a human, moral to kill an ape, and somewhat immoral to kill a human/ape hybrid? How about a human with tomato genes spliced in to have shinier skin, is it a bit better to kill them? As far as I know there is no  person gene  per se.  I'm really thinking planet of the Apes here, is it right for the apes to enslave Charlton Heston because he's not Ape? Or would it be right for a bunch of humans to enslave Cornelius on the grounds he isn't human, even though  he can talk ?
