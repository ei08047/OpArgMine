You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?  I don't follow you here. Can you back up your little sacred  trust  theory? There is no trust between an embryo and a woman. An embryo cannot feel trust, it cannot even feel itself. Its really only a hunk of cells, and saying that it trusts the woman is like me saying that the flowers in my garden trust me to water them. And, at what point does a life become  sacred . I'm sure you've weeded your garden, is that an embarrasing disregard for sacred life? Is hunting an embarrassing disregard for sacred life? By your logic, i can call almost anything a  sacred life .
