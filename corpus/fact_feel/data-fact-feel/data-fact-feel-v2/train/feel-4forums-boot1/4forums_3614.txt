The bombing a city in wartime, killing non combatants is  taking the life of a defenseless person . Do you regard it as murder?  The execution by the state of a convicted felon is  taking the life of a defenseless person . Do you regard that as murder?  Exceed the speed limit in your car and in the process collide with a child and their death will be  taking the life of a defenseless person . Have you murdered them?  If you say yes to all three, then you have an unusual idea of murder, but at least you are consistent. To not say yes to all three exposes you as a hypocrite who assigns the label  murder  to a human death as your personal moral whims take your fancy.  Person is a label that is and has been applied differently by different societies through the ages. I personally think it utterly inane to seek to apply the label to a fetus before it is around 3 weeks old for example. The case for applying the label then steadily grows as the fetus grows. Assuming it develops normally, by birth it's definitely deserving of the label.
