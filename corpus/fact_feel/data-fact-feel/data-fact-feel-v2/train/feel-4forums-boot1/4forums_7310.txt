The VPC is hardly a real source. If any thing what this shows is the real and pressing need to close the border. Splain exactly how they get up here to do the dastardly deeds. What is interesting is how many laws were broken to buy and get the weapons back into Mexico. Sounds like a problem with lax enforcement.  PS what exactly are  cop killer handguns  beyond an attempt to get the unknowing public aroused and enraged. The self same bunch of loons touted  cop killer  bullets and Hollywierd even jumped on the bandwagon with a movie. The only fly in the ointment was they couldn't trot out a single case when a LEO died from bullets penetrating the vest.
