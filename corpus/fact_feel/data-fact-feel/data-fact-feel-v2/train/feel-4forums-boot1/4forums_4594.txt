But, now here's the thing, what about the peole with unwanted babies aren't good people. In my opinion, the vast majority unwanted babies aren't from good people.  A good woman having an unwanted baby is a completely diffeent case, but, as I said, it doesn't often occur that a good woman has an unwanted baby.
