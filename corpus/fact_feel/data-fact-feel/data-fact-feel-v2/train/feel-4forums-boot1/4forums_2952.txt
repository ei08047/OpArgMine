But didn't you know? The USA is a CHRISTIAN NATION and all other beliefs are subservient to that. They don't get it, they actally believe that they're doing good and are also doing it for our own good as well.  It isn't terrorists, or any other outside force which are a threat to American rights and freedoms, it is those like the Christian right who you truly have to fear. Those like Pat Robertson, or Jerry Falwel who have influence and many others as well like your President. How many other Judges feel and believe the same as Judge Moore in Alabama did?
