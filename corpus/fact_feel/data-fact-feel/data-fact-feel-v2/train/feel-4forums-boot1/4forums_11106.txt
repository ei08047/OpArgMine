Hi Boopee.  I don't know what to say. Never thought I'd be compared to Hitler. Yikes! Um, well, ya. So, I guess if you're interested, I'll give some reasons why I'm against abortion.  Here's some links to articles about it on Boundless (a webzine). (if you want to, just go to www.boundless.org and type abortion into the search bar)  http://www.boundless.org/2001/regula.../a0000567.html  http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000229.html  http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html (read this, if no others)  I oppose abortion because....  a) I beleive the unborn is a valuable human being, and therfore abortion is murder  b) I beleive that abortion hurts women (see links)  Yah, those are the basic reasons.
