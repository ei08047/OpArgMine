Doesn't that explain why manslaughter is like miscarriage, rather than why it is different?  And Clerisian, you didn't seem to be arguing that the two were distinct, rather you appeared to say that pro-lifers did support charging mothers who miscarried with manslaughter (where the mother's actions, say, drinking heavily, were the cause of death).
