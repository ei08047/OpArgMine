Sorry my brain wasn't working that early this morning. What I was trying to say was I can't understand those who wish to completely take guns away from civilians. Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right.
