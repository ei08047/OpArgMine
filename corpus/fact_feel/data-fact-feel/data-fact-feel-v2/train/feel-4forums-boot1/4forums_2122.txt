Well, I'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not, but his doctor gave him daily  vitamin  shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial.  And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian.  I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie.  I don't see how being a tetotaller and a vegetarian are good characteristics.
