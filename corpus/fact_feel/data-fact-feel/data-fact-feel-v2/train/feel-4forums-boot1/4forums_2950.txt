Please give basic background:  Age, State of residence, Marital status, Education Level, Religious Affiliation, Occupation.  I'm 56 and have been studying Creation/Evolution for over 30 years. I live in Godfrey, IL and am on the speakers bureau of the Missouri Association for Creation. I'm married, have a B.A. in Earth Science and a Secondary Teaching Certification. I'm a Reformed Baptist (as Charles Spurgeon was) and am a Geospatial Analyst for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in St. Louis. I'm a Young Earth Creationist but also an Intelligent Designer.  I use to be the E-mail Correspondent for MAC and had many interesting discussions with evolutionists and Old age creationists. I had one formal debate at Florida State University in Tallahassee where I taught school.  Just some fodder for your paper.  DaRook
