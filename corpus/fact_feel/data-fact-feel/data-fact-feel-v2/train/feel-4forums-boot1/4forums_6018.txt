So what makes a life a life? Does it have to be able to breath? Does it have to be able to have blood in the lungs, does it have to be able to blink, does it have to be able to survive on its own? Does it have to be able to not live without using someone elses  resources ? Hmm all good questions I guess....the last one is commonly used. But a parasite is considered a living parasite when it is sucking on your blood . An unborn can be using the mothers resources but still be a life. A human life.  Keep in mind this post is about when is a person a person...So keep it on track with when is a life a life.
