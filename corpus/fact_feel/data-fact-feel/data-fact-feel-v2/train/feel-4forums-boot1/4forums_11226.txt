Exagerating the position of another is a typical technique for ridiculing it moose, but your attempts to do that does nothing to detract from the accuracy of the article and my opinion, in that this is a premeditated agenda in order to normalize the homosexual lifestyle within one more generation in this Country. And only a liar would deny it as it's so obvious. If what I say wasn't true then gay groups would take the attitude of hands off off the minds of minors until they're old enough to decide for themselves what is morally right and wrong. What is going on can only be defined as INDOCTRINATION, So you can laugh all you want to, but I'm not laughing at all.
