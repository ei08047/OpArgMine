I don't care what medical standards are, having a bacterial infection doesn't mean that you have actual culture on your side.  What's really going on is a war of opinions and beliefs. On one side you have the group that believes in individual rights and freedoms, and on the other you have those believe that, since no right is absolute in scope, that's the green light to go ahead and attempt to restrict and infringe on anything and everything they can, through any method available to them.
