Do you see cops driving down the road, going over the speed limit, turning on their lights during rush hour to get to their exit which is just a little ways ahead and then turn their lights off after they exit the highway. People who enforce the law think that they are better than the law, and don't have follow the law, even if they enforce the law, or make them, i personally think that is Bull****!!!
