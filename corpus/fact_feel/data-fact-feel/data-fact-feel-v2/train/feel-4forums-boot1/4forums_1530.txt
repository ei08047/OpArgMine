Oh, so is your God the Chinese government? Honestly, most atheists will say people believe in God because they can't think for themselves and must rely on something in order to exist. Where's the difference? The Chinese follow the Chinese government like puppy dogs because they can't think for themselves, and they rely on the government in order to survive.
