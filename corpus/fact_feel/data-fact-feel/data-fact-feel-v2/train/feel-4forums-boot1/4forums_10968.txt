How about the one about the universe being created when the great god (the great Green Arkleseizure) blew his nose?  No, wait a minute, that was Douglas Adam's  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy   The Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.  The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.  However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle VI.  http://www.dwave.net/~tony/Mars/hgttg2.htm
