Considering the avg number of capital punishments a year is around 70..... think of the 4000 babies in the womb that arent guilty of any crimes that are everyday being slaughtered through abortion.....  Just putting some things in perspective for you......  Just as many people died in the world trade center attack on September 11th, thats how many babies die from abortion everyday in America....  There have been 2000 soldiers that have died in Iraq... thats only half the number of babies that die everyday from abortion on our own soil....  What a shame for the  land of the free  that has  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ...  THERE IS GENOCIDE HAPPENING AND NO ONE IS STANDING UP FOR THE TRUE INNOCENT AMONG US! in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION! Truly they are for the life of the innocent right.... ???? (said sarcatically)
