And if people have a  religious belief  whereby they don't think blacks should vote, or that interracial marriage should occur, should governmental officials who have those  religious beliefs  just be allowed to ignore their duty?  What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians? Should that be respected as well?  They are paid to do their job. People who get to pick and choose what their  job  should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work.  If when I was in the military, I had suddenly stood up and said,  Woah! Hey! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others, and this plan of action will hurt other people.   Should that be respected and I keep my  job ?
