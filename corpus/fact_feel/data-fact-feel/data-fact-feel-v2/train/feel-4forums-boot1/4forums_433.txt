And you're quite naive if you think that emotional examples mean anything against the facts. The so-called  Partial Birth  Abortion is quite rare and usually only performed to save the mother's life, but now they're going to have to let the mother die because Dubya has banned this now thus the first step to going back to the  good old days  when women were nothing more than property. You're the sick one.  Also, with your resorting to such tactics shows that you are losing.  BTW, isn't putting  Your god  under your name somewhat sacrilegious by putting yourself above your god? I guess that I'll be seeing you in Hell.
