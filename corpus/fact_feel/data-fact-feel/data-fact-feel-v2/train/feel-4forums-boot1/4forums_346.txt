Wrong again. If she supported bans on all guns then why would she say  I know the sense of helplessness that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.   Shes Jewish too so shes definitly not on Hitlers side.
