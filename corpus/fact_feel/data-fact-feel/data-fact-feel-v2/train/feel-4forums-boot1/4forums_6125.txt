Archangel is right on this one. It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person.  It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says  we don't value human life . If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human, is not an individual, is not alive, or is in some other way not worthy of respect. Or you have to make a case that ending it's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things.  I am pro-choice, but only because I don't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity. The suffering and anguish caused by banning abortion is substantial and should not be dismissed, but equally when abortion is legal it should not be seen as a substitute for contraception. How to achieve this is a difficult one, without causing psychological harm to women who feel they must make that choice.
