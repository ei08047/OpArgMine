Really! Will you grant me the same benefit? Lets just say I have no moral problem with physically hurting you. Would you suggest that people who think that is wrong should not impose their belief system on me? You would certainly think they should impose their belief system on me. Chances are you would say something like  well, I am a human so therefore I have certain rights  to which I would respond that chloe and I believe the fetus is a human and we believe you are a human too so therefore the same standard applies.  The argument about not pushing your beliefs on others just never works because every law is pushing beliefs on people.
