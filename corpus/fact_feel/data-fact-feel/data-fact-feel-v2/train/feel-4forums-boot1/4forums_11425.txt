Good read Waxy,  Note 3 stands out to me in such a way that lends  some  creedence to my original post. The  silent  majority is speaking loudly to what means ? To stifle the religous sector in our society , to where it will come to the point of them proving their beliefs or shut up ?  Or , is the silent majority being stirred from the insides of their very soul , to ask questions about their existence , knowing that their belief in the Big Bang theory , just cannot be ALL there is to human life ?
