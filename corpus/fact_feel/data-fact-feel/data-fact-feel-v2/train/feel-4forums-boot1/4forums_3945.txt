I'm unclear on the laws in Europe, where from what I understand this happened, but in the state where I live, if a baby is born alive, even during an abortion, doctors have the legal responsibility to do whatever they can to save the life of the baby, and they also have the legal obligation to save the mother's life, and when the baby doesn't have a chance for survival, they legally have try to save the mother.  Babies can not survive in the womb without amniotic fluid, and the longer they are in there with fluid leaking, the greater the risks to mother and baby. If fluid is leaking, they have to do something soon, either by inducing labor or performing an abortion, depending on how close to term the baby is, and it's chances of survival outside the womb.
