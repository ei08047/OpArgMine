Well, i guess that depends on your definition of intellectual. Rational judgement would put one down the path of pro-life, however, I must say there are plenty of people above me that I would call an intellectual before I call myself that. Justice Scalia comes to mind. And likewise, I wouldn't accuse you of being in the  intellectual  coloumn either.
