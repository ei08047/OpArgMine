Excerpt from the study  What the Hell kind of study is this? They take random shooting cases and determined that 6% had a weapon nearby. Did they check to see if the person had that weapon legally? Were they drug dealers shot during a turf war? Were they criminals shot by other criminals?  And then they randomly call up Philly residents and ask them if they have guns in their house?  The $hit that is passed off as science nowadays scares the Hell out of me!
