The pro-life position isn't even formost about the law. It is about stopping abortions, period. That is why so many pro-life people work in counseling centers, not legal offices. Your implication that pro-lifers do not vary in their views is just plain ridiculous--I myself am living proof that they do. I am certainly pro-life, but I don't oppose very early term abortions or when the life of the mother is in definite danger.
