nobody said that incest was the same as homosexuality. however, Im sure you would agree that people in incestuous relationships are being socially pressure similar to the gay community a few years ago. so think about it, an incestuous couple cannot legally get married or benefit from any of the rights that homosexuals are protesting for. yet, like gays, their position is that they are consenting adults that are not hurting anyone by their actions. the sanctioning of gay marriages will very likely open the doors for incest marriage. bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.  while nobody equated homosexuality to incest, there are grounds of commonality between the 2, and thats what the discussion was about. I hope you see that
