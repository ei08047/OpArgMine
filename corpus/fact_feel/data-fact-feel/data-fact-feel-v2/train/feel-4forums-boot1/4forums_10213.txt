Common sense must prevail. There are always exceptions to every rule. Barring severe physical ailments to the mother or the child, or a rape victim, if anything is done to prevent life from continuing, I can only see it as wrong. I am not a zealot, but I do feel strongly that unnecessarily discarding a developing baby is not a right that anyone should have.
