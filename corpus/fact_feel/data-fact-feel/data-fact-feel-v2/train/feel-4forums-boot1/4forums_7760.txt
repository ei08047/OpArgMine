Report: Kennedy barred from communion by bishop  Nov. 22, 2009  PROVIDENCE, R.I. ? Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion, the central sacrament of the church, in Rhode Island because of the congressman's support for abortion rights, Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday.  The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family.   The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,  Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.  Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him  that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,  particularly on abortion.

Now do that with the rest of the Biblically-challenged, spiritually-inept Kennedy family, and all the rest of the pro-abortion Catholic democrats.
