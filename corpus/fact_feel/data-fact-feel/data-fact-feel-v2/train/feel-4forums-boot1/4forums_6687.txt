As it stands in the uk a father has no sat whatsoever in the welfare of the baby/fetus if his partener wants to terminate he need never even be told.  I am with you on the life or death of the mother senario although it is my beleif that as a mother it is my job to give my life in exchange of that of my child/baby/fetus.
