If you literally mean  kill,  then you are right. However, many pro-lifers use  kill  as a synonym for  murder.  Given the strength of your rhetoric, I assumed that you were a pro-lifer equating the choice of abortion with a choice of murder, which is an unsupported controversial assertion. If you meant that a choice to abort is a choice to kill, regardless of the moral status (murder or non-murder) of that particular act of killing, then I agree with you, although I'm not sure why you bothered to say it.
