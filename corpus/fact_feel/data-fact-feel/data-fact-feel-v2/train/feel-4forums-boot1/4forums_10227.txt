You will never help the poor with a socialist system. The first casuality of a socialist state is the spirit of charity. The concept of charity in European societies does not exist, because it is the government job to the help the poor.  Government officials just don't strike me as being natural care givers. What then happens is you get a token  official  who pretends to give a rats pututie for carring about the poor, to make all the heartless people in a socialist state feel good that the government is doing something.
