Here is a text from Mike Moore's own website:  DONAHUE: OK, so let's understand. You'd like a ban on the sale of handguns.  MOORE: Yes. I believe that we don't need handguns.  No the question beggs. Did Mike Moore ever employ a body guard with gun? I'll change my opinion on this matter if I get better information. But I think you and I know the answer don't we?
