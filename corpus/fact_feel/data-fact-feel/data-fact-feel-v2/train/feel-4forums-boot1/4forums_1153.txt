It sounds like these poor kids were rather manipulated. I feel terrible for them.  I'm no expert, but alot of these sound (unexplained pains, anxieties, depression, panic attacks) sound like symptoms of PAS, yes? Do you know what brought these symptoms on? Also, can you get more specific-what chronic/acute diseases?  Are you saying that their breast cancer was brought on by their mind/bodies' guilt over what they did? It's psychosomatic?  So can women can cure themselves? Is that what you mean? Or do you mean that once they forgive themselves they can move on to help other women do the same?  thanks in advance...  I don't  believe  I would suffer depression or regret after having an abortion, I know I wouldn't.  Bell prepares for attack...
