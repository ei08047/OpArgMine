first of all.. to those who wonder why men dont' have a say in abortion, I think the answer is obvious  1. is the man the one who is pregnant? No. He is the one who will take care of the woman but obviously if he wants the child after birth then he doesnt' mind taking care of anyone. He is not the one who is going to go through of all the changes that she is and he is not the one who will be scarred for life.  2. How do we know that man is somebody worth gestating for and won't leave the woman after it is born? We don't, so I am not going to gestate for someone who very well may up and leave after its' born.  3. What if the woman didn't want sex the night of conception and he didn't necessarily pressure her.. but nag her and she decided to give in to shut him up? I know that sound ridiculous to some of you but what if?
