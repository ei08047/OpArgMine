 [On ancient Athens]: In the end, more than freedom, they wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it all &#8211; security, comfort, and freedom. When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again.  &#8211; Edward Gibbon  History repeats itself when forgotten.
