You don't get it do you?   our side  has never said we where above these things. Your side takes the  moral highground  they set up a standard of being holier then thou. There is no hypocrisy in pointing out those who can't live up to the standard they set for themselves or would legally force upon the rest of us.  The problem is that your side has made sex evil and dirty and our side is just pointing that out to you.
