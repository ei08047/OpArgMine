On the issue of not living at all i m not shure there is a reasonable answer as to how someone who was never born could possibly recognise not exsisting as being   worse than living...    Let me say I personally don't like the idea of aborting a pregnancy. However I can't possibly understand how we would not FIRST adopt all those kids in homes first and then fight the battel for saving the unwanted unborn.
