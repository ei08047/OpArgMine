You just don't get it. Americans are freemen. Your faith in governments over people is humorous... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords..... Rights are inalienable to man. One man has NO right to intefere with another man. I should be able to do as I please as long as I do not intefere with others... How does your government feel about that?
