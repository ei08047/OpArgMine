Which, to my mind, is the more proper way to do things. Having the people decide on legislative matters seems alot like having a commitee of your neighbors decide on the proper way to perform your heart surgery. Too many states make it far too easy to get an issue on the ballot, and alot of very stupid laws and constituional amendments have resulted. Take a look at California politics if you want some examples.
