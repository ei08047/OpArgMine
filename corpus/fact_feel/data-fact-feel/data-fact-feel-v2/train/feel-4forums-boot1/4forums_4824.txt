Really, so California is just a peachy crime free place because of its strict firearms laws? What about New York? But wait! Don't forget good ol Washington DC! Their crime rate is lower than Bush's approval rating because of their strict firearm laws!  Of course they are going to have a higher rate of firearms death, but they're obviously going to have a lower rate of everything else (criminal related) death. In the end, Its lower.
