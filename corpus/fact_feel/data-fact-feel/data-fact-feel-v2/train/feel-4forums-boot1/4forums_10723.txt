So that no girl, underage or otherwise, refuses to seek treatment for fear of what their parents will think or say. If a girl cannot be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex (or fears their wrath), she may not go in for testing.  In general, knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing.
