You don't really care which side, you just like the argument, huh?  Where is this type of abortion commonly done? Once they have finished  ripping  the unborn (abortion isn't very relevant once born) fetus from the womb what do they do with it? What do you suppose the primary reason for waiting until until the baby is crowning to abort? Seems odd to go thru 9 months and labor to change one's mind.  Why do suppose exaggeration and embellishment or an aversion to facts is necessary for some people who consider themselves pro life or at least anti choice?
