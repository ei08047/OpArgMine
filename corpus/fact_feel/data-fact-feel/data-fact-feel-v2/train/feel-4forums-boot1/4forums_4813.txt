This statement simply doesn't make sense to me. Same-sex marriage was an issue long before those events, and it will remain an issue long after those events. The majority has always been looking for an excuse to harm homosexuals, to do evil, not because the majority is evil, but because the majority is misinformed and prejudiced. They twisted whatever event came their way into an excuse to cause harm. Or at least that is what I believe to have happened with many people.
