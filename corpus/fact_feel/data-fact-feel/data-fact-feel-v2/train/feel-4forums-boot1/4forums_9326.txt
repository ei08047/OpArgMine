Yes, we want to teach that it's acceptable to be gay. You obviously have a problem with that. What lesson would you wish to teach? Would you wish to teach that it's not acceptable, that it is wrong, worthy of prejudice and marginalization? Would you pretend it doesn't exist, realizing that it does exist, meaning you are still forced to acknowledge what it is you don't permit speaking of, i.e.,  the love the name of which dare not be spoken ? That is still teaching that love as something negative.  Further, heterosexuality is taught and talked about, and you don't consider that indoctrination. I'd say you wish to indoctrinate heterosexism and homophobia?
