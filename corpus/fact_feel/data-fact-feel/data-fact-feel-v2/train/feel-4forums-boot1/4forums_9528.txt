Thanks for clearing that up. Studies already show that younger Americans are more supportive of gays and lesbians, even when it comes to marriage. Actually, as foundit has pointed out, a majority of Americans already favor gays serving openly in the military. President Bush speaks so much about  the will of the people , but ignores them when it comes to the military policy towards gays. Change will happen, I just wish it were sooner, rather than later.
