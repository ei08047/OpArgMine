No, actually it doesn't at all. If that is so, then Popi the sailor man is also the Great  I Am . The Greek for the 'I AM' in John is 'Ego Emni' , while if he wanted to say he was god, it would be 'ego emi ho on' . Do try to understand that you are reading a translation of a translation.  If you bothered to read what the storyline in is about, you know, context, you would see that the writer of the Gospel of John was saying on The father was greater than Jesus. In context, this is saying that Jesus is claiming to be greater than Abraham,  Before  Abraham in priority, not before Abraham in time.  So, your example is null and void. I suspect that due to your ignorance and hate, I will get a flip off answer rather than respond to this point.
