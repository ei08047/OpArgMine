If you can convince me that your soul mate, best friend, the one that you can't think of anyone else you would want to share your life, dreams, fears, successes with, who knows what your thinking and loves you anyway and feels the same then sure I guess I would consider it. Since we are on the subject of ridiculous how about a snowflake or a pine tree or a sunflower seed, talk about love blossoming.
