I've heard a lot of naive stuff before, but that's a new one. I don't think I've ever heard anything more simpleminded in nature.  With your own government dictating that you can't inflict injury on those that would hurt you, they're not acting in your best interest. Nor are they when the police are tasked with making sure your windows and doors are locked up tight at night.
