The link doesn't work. This is unfortunate if it applies to public officials. I believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public, equally under the law. That's their job. I'm glad they have to do their job in Canada. Would you want a public servant to refuse you because he or she does not share your Evangelical beliefs, jyoshu?
