If gay marriage were as spelled out in the constitution the way voting is, I might agree with you. But it's not. The best you can do with gay marriage is to make it fit into an amendment that doesn't specifically mention it, that was written about an unrelated issue. With the legality of the issue so vague, what do you expect? If you want to avoid people voting on issues like this, perhaps you should follow historical precedent in dealing with civil rights issues and get an amendment passed that spells it out.
