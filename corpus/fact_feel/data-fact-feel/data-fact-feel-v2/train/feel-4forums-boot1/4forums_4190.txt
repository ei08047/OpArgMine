Typicall response from the liberals on this thread has been to devise a plan to control crime, then worry about the civil rights violations later. The first principle of the liberals here has been  workability  and  practically , not civil rights.  When challenged with a root cause that both sides have agreed upon, it is still the probelm is still guns. When challenged with a solution that addresses the  workability  and  practically  of civil rights as a first principle and a root cause that both sides have agreed upon, the problem liberals focus on is still guns.  To pull a quote from an anti gunner on this board, please forgive the mis quote and feel free to correct me if I am wrong :  I do not need guns, never have needed them , and never will.   How about an open mind?
