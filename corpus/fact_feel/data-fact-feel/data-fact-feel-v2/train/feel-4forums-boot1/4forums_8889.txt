Daily Herald | Mayor Daley lays out strict gun rules for Chicago  That particular rule, wouldn't that mean anybody who lives in Chicago and buys a handgun, wouldn't legally be able to take the gun from the shop to their home, because that would mean having it out on city streets, which is illegal?  Didn't Ohio or some city there try just that move a while back?
