Anti-gunners don't care. They want ALL the guns not matter what is historically correct. Men who lived during the birth of this country were made of a much different metal than liberal anti-gunners today. What once considered a persons responsibility and own personal domain has been superceeded for  collective good  and what is  benefit to society . Never mind that democracy is fragile and that the majority of all living humans past and present has lived not as free men. Never mind that that those lessons and hard won freedoms are traded away for the convience of state care and protection. Yes horrific crimes are commited with firearms, but they are commited by evil men. Good and evil can be equally acomplished by a firearm. Never mind that evil men commit evil acts and good men can do good with the same firearm. What matters most to anti-gunners is that the evil and the good should be punished together for the common good of society.
