Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?  Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce  remotely  from Virginia.  Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.
