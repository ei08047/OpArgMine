Well let me first get to this just so everyone will know which side of the gun issue im on, I am an avid gun owner and I support any laws that target criminals while unafecting lawfull gun owners. I only posted this thread to gather poinions and speculation, mostly from the anti-gun side. They say that we gun owners have a fantasy view of reality after a total gun ban, so I just thought I might like to hear their thoughts on life after a total gun ban. Will some of their views make sense, or will their views be just as crazy as they claim our views are. Inquiring minds want to know!
