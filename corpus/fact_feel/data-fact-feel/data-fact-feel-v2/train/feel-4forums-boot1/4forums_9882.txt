Taking away peoples right to an abortion is a great idea !!  People are confused and don't really know they want a kid, they just think they don't. It will all be alright after the kid arrives, .. they will discover we know best and keep and love and shelter these kids in a nurturing way. We know best and we know that none of them will ever just end up in a trash can or droped off at the local childrens home to join the thousands of other unwanted kids. None will ever become a pawn in a divorce situation, nore will any of them be sold into child slavery or prostitution.  How do we know all this ? .. We just know people who don't think they are ready for or want a kid really do !!  They will love and nurture it and all will be well.
