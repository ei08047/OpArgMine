I have, at various times saud I'm not really for late term abortions. I am NOT, however, appluding this ruling. Apparently you didn't read it thoroughly enough (either that or are purposely trying to get a  dig  in). The ruling says  Obviously you know that those that have stated we are not for late-term abortions also add the qualifier of allowing it in cases where the woman's health is threatened (see the thread set up by another_opinion - if I remember correctly who set it up). This decision obviously does not do this, and I am disgusted at this ruling. If it had, I would be applauding along with you, but it didn't.  EDIT: looks like Another_opinion beat me to it.
