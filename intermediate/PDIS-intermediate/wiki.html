<H1>Key components of argumentation</H1>
<span/><span/>
<ul>	
	<li><p>Understanding and identifying arguments, either explicit or implied, and the goals of the participants in the different types of dialogue.</p></li>
	<li><p>Identifying the premises from which conclusions are derived</p></li>
	<li><p>Establishing the "burden of proof" – determining who made the initial claim and is thus responsible for providing evidence why his/her position merits acceptance.</p></li>
	<li><p>For the one carrying the "burden of proof", the advocate, to marshal evidence for his/her position in order to convince or force the opponent's acceptance. The method by which this is accomplished is producing valid, sound, and cogent arguments, devoid of weaknesses, and not easily attacked.</p></li>
	<li><p>In a debate, fulfillment of the burden of proof creates a burden of rejoinder. One must try to identify faulty reasoning in the opponent's argument, to attack the reasons/premises of the argument, to provide counterexamples if possible, to identify any fallacies, and to show why a valid conclusion cannot be derived from the reasons provided for his/her argument.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophical burden of proof :</h2>
<span/>
<p> In epistemology, the burden of proof is the obligation on a party in a dispute to provide sufficient warrant for their position.</p>
<span/><span/>
<h3>Holder of the burden</h3>
<span/>
<p>When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it challenges a perceived status quo.[1]</p>
<span/>
<p>When we have no evidence to resolve the proposition, we may suspend judgment. From a cognitive sense, when no personal preference toward opposing claims exists, one may be either skeptical of both claims or ambivalent of both claims.[14][15][16] If there is a dispute, the burden of proof falls onto the challenger of the status quo from the perspective of any given social narrative.[17] If there is no agreeable and adequate proof of evidence to support a claim, the claim is considered an argument from ignorance.[</p>
<span/><span/>
<h4>Argument from ignorance</h4>
<span/>
<p>Argument from ignorance (from Latin: argumentum ad ignorantiam), also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents "a lack of contrary evidence"), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false (or vice versa). This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that: there may have been an insufficient investigation, and therefore there is insufficient information to prove the proposition be either true or false. Nor does it allow the admission that the choices may in fact not be two (true or false), but may be as many as four,true,false,unknown between true or false
being unknowable (among the first three).</p>
<span/>
<p>In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the burden of proof.</p>

<H1>Argumentation framework</H1>
<span/>
<p>In artificial intelligence and related fields, an argumentation framework, or argumentation system, is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it.</p>
<span/>
<ul>
	<li>
		<div>
		<p>argumentation frameworks à la Dung</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A set of abstract elements called arguments, denoted A</p></li>
			<li><p>A binary relation on A , called attack relation, denoted R </p></li>
		</ul>

	<li>Logic-based argumentation frameworks</li>
	<li>Value-based argumentation frameworks</li>
	<li>Assumption-based argumentation frameworks</li>

<h2>Interpretive argumentation</h2><span/>
<p>Interpretive argumentation is a dialogical process in which participants explore and/or resolve interpretations often of a text of any medium containing significant ambiguity in meaning.</p>

	<h1>Components of argument</h1>
	<p>In The Uses of Argument (1958), Toulmin proposed a layout containing six interrelated components for analyzing arguments:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Claim: Conclusions whose merit must be established. For example, if a person tries to convince a listener that he is a British citizen, the claim would be "I am a British citizen." (1)</li>
		<li>Data: The facts we appeal to as a foundation for the claim. For example, the person introduced in 1 can support his claim with the supporting data "I was born in Bermuda." (2)</li>
		<li>Warrant: The statement authorizing our movement from the data to the claim. In order to move from the data established in 2, "I was born in Bermuda," to the claim in 1, "I am a British citizen," the person must supply a warrant to bridge the gap between 1 & 2 with the statement "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen." (3)</li>
		<li>Backing: Credentials designed to certify the statement expressed in the warrant; backing must be introduced when the warrant itself is not convincing enough to the readers or the listeners. For example, if the listener does not deem the warrant in 3 as credible, the speaker will supply the legal provisions as backing statement to show that it is true that "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen."</li>
		<li>
			Rebuttal: Statements recognizing the restrictions to which the claim may legitimately be applied. The rebuttal is exemplified as follows, "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British citizen, unless he has betrayed Britain and has become a spy of another country."
		</li>
		<li>
			Qualifier: Words or phrases expressing the speaker's degree of force or certainty concerning the claim. Such words or phrases include "possible," "probably," "impossible," "certainly," "presumably," "as far as the evidence goes," or "necessarily." The claim "I am definitely a British citizen" has a greater degree of force than the claim "I am a British citizen, presumably."
		</li>
	</ul>
